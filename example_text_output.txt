tf.Tensor(b'Item\xc2\xa07.\n    Management\xe2\x80\x99s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information\nthat we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operation and financial condition. You should\nread this analysis in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related footnotes. This discussion and\nanalysis contains statements of a forward-looking nature relating to future events or our future financial performance. These statements\ninvolve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, level of activity, performance\nor achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or\nimplied by these forward-looking statements, including those set forth in this Form 10-K. \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n    29\n    \xc2\xa0\n    \n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\nOverview\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWe are a residential and small business commercial solar energy\nengineering, procurement and construction firm. We offer turnkey services, including design, procurement, permitting, build-out,\ngrid connection, financing referrals and warranty and customer satisfaction activities. Our solar energy systems use high-quality\nsolar photovoltaic modules. We use proven technologies and techniques to help customers achieve meaningful savings by reducing\ntheir utility costs. In addition, we help customers lower their reliance upon fossil fuel energy sources. As of September 29, 2017,\nwe are the exclusive domestic and international licensee of POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 in-roof solar shingle, an innovative and aesthetically\npleasing solar shingle system developed by Dow.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWe, including our predecessors, have more than 39 years of experience\nin residential solar energy and trace our roots to 1978, when Real Goods Trading Corporation sold the first solar photovoltaic\npanels in the United States. We have designed and installed over 26,000 residential and commercial solar energy systems since our\nfounding.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nDuring 2014, we discontinued our entire former Commercial segment\nand sold the assets associated with our catalog business (a portion of the Other segment). As of September 30, 2017, we created\na new segment for our POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 business. As a result, we now operate as four reportable segments: (1)\xc2\xa0Residential\n\xe2\x80\x93 the installation of solar energy systems for homeowners, including lease financing thereof, and small business commercial\nin the continental United States; (2)\xc2\xa0Sunetric \xe2\x80\x93 the installation of solar energy systems for both homeowners and business\nowners (commercial) in Hawaii; (3) POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 - the manufacturing and sales of solar shingles; and (4)\xc2\xa0Other \xe2\x80\x93\ncorporate operations. We believe this structure enables us to more effectively manage our operations and resources.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWe generally recognize revenue from solar energy systems sold\nto our customers when we install the solar energy system. Our business requires that we incur costs of acquiring solar panels and\nlabor to install solar energy systems on our customer rooftops up-front and receive cash from customers thereafter. As a result,\nduring periods when we are increasing sales, we expect to have negative cash flow from operations.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nPOWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 License Agreement\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nA material significant event occurred on September 29, 2017\n(the \xe2\x80\x9cEffective Date\xe2\x80\x9d), when we executed the License with Dow, providing an exclusive domestic and international right to commercialize its POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 in-roof solar shingle,\nan innovative and aesthetically pleasing solar shingle system developed by Dow. The POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 1.0 and 2.0 versions used\nCIGS (copper indium gallium selenide solar cells) technology which had a high manufacturing cost, resulting in the product not\nbeing consumer price friendly. Conversely, the POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 3.0 is being developed with traditional silicon solar cells to\nincrease solar production and to provide a competitive consumer price point. The License requires us to commercialize and sell\na minimum of 50 megawatts of solar within 5-years of the Effective Date to retain exclusive world-wide rights, a requirement we\nbelieve is achievable.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nIn addition to the License, we executed a Trademark License Agreement\n(the \xe2\x80\x9cTLA\xe2\x80\x9d), a Technology Service Agreement (the \xe2\x80\x9cTSA\xe2\x80\x9d) and a Sales Agreement-Surplus Property (the \xe2\x80\x9cSales\nAgreement\xe2\x80\x9d) with Dow. The execution of the TLA will allow us to market the POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 3.0 product using the Dow name.\nThe Sales Agreement identified used manufacturing molds that Dow transferred title to us for a cost of $1.00.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nUnder the terms of the License, we will produce, market and\nsell POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 3.0, for which we have agreed to a license fee of $3 million and a running royalty fee equal to 2.5% against\nnet sales of the POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 product and services, payable quarterly in arrears. Further, we will be responsible for all\npost-Effective Date costs to obtain UL Certification and for the prosecution\nof all related patents world-wide, which may be offset against the payment of the running royalty fee. The license fee is comprised\nof two payments; the first $1 million was paid within 10 days of the Effective Date of the License in 2017 in accordance with the\nTLA. The remaining $2 million is due within 30 days of the Company receiving UL Certification of the POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 3.0 product.\nUpon obtaining UL Certification, we intend to begin commercialization of POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 3.0 entailing the manufacturing, marketing\nand sale of POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 3.0 to roofing companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nAs of December 31, 2017, we have invested approximately $1.1 million\nthat has been capitalized to the POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 License, an intangible asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n    30\n    \xc2\xa0\n    \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOther Key Metrics\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nBacklog\n\nBacklog is discussed below and an important\nmetric as we implement our revenue growth strategy.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nKey Operational Metric, Gross Margin\non Residential Segment, Our Largest Segment \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWe utilize a job costing system whereby\nemployees record their time to projects. We accumulate the cost of idle time reflecting the cost we incur to maintain a construction\norganization until our revenue grows, allowing for greater utilization of our construction organization. Cost of goods sold (\xe2\x80\x9cCOGS\xe2\x80\x9d)\ninclude direct project installation costs (materials, labor, travel, financing fees, and estimated warranty costs) and indirect\ncosts for project installation support (including un-utilized labor of idle time of construction crews, supplies, and insurance).\nWe employ an internal time reporting system to determine COGS and resulting gross margin percentage used by the company to measure\nits performance in achieving gross margin percentage targets. Further, we measure COGS per watt based upon COGS, excluding idle\ntime, divided by the aggregate watts of systems installed during the period. For financial reporting purposes, COGS include the\nidle time of construction crews currently maintained by the company in anticipation of future growth of backlog. Gross margin percentage\non actual installation time is not a measure defined by generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, as a result of the competitive\nlandscape, the average selling price per watt (\xe2\x80\x9cASP\xe2\x80\x9d) declined at a greater rate than the cost of installation per\nwatt. Accordingly, our ASP declined 10% resulting in a roughly 6% and 8% decline in gross margin based on actual installation\ntime and including idle time, respectively. We anticipate an improvement in our gross margin percentage in future periods from\nincreased revenue from our implementation of our revenue growth strategy.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n    \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n    Twelve Months Ended \nDecember 31, 2017\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n    Twelve Months Ended \nDecember 31, 2016\xc2\xa0\n\n    Gross margin % on actual installation time\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa024%\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa030%\n\n    Gross margin % including idle time\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa013%\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa021%\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nBacklog \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nBacklog represents the dollar amount of revenue that may be\nrecognized in the future from signed contracts to install solar energy systems that have not yet been installed without taking\ninto account possible future cancellations. Backlog is not a measure defined by generally accepted accounting principles, and\nis not a measure of contract profitability. Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to methodologies used\nby other companies in determining their backlog amounts. The backlog amounts we disclose are net of cancellations received and\ninclude anticipated revenues associated with (i) the original contract amounts, and (ii) change orders for which we have received\nwritten confirmations from customers. Backlog may not be indicative of future operating results, and projects in our backlog may\nbe cancelled, modified or otherwise altered by customers.\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe following table summarizes changes to our backlog by segment\nfor the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017:\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n    (in thousands)\xc2\xa0\n    Residential\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n    Sunetric\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n    Totals\xc2\xa0\n\n    Backlog at January 1, 2016\xc2\xa0\n    $9,502\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n    $7,195\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n    $16,697\xc2\xa0\n\n    Bookings from new awards (\xe2\x80\x9cSales\xe2\x80\x9d)\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa015,186\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa0693\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa015,879\xc2\xa0\n\n    Cancellations and reductions on existing contracts\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa0(5,152)\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa0(1,484)\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa0(6,636)\n\n    Amounts recognized in revenue upon installation\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa0(12,609)\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa0(3,956)\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa0(16,565)\n\n    Backlog at December 31, 2016\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa06,927\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa02,448\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa09,375\xc2\xa0\n\n    Bookings from new awards (\xe2\x80\x9cSales\xe2\x80\x9d)\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa023,400\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa03,196\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa026,596\xc2\xa0\n\n    Cancellations and reductions on existing contracts\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa0(8,005)\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa0(1,201)\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa0(9,206)\n\n    Amounts recognized in revenue upon installation\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa0(11,801)\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa0(2,199)\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa0(14,000)\n\n    Backlog at December 31, 2017\xc2\xa0\n    $10,521\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n    $2,244\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n    $12,765\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n    31\n    \xc2\xa0\n    \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWe have experienced a high level of contract cancellations,\nwhich we attribute to (i) the competitive nature of the solar industry wherein customers shop price after signing a contract and\nexercise their right to cancel during a three day rescission period after we countersign their contract, (ii) customer home\xe2\x80\x99s\nphysical condition requires upgrades that they may not be able to afford or reduces their return on investment, (iii) delays to\ninstalling their system within their desired timeframe, and (iv) our history of operating losses and resulting declining stock\nprice affecting customer decisions. We determined that for optimum internal operations, and customer satisfaction, that a backlog\nequivalent to a few months of sales is optimal.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWe intend to continue the optimization of our e-sales call -center-\nbased sales organization with the goal of increasing our future sales awards, both for our current states of operation and new\nstates where we may operate in future periods. Our customers currently finance their acquisition of solar energy systems using\ntheir own cash, or a loan they receive from a financial provider. We believe that to be successful in increasing our sales and\nresultant revenue, we intend to do the following as part of our revenue growth strategy:\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xb7Invest in the POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 license by obtaining UL Certification for POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 3.0, a prerequisite for\n                                                                                                               commercialization of the product and, upon achieving UL Certification, manufacture, market and sell the POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 3.0\n                                                                                                               to roofing companies and new home builders;\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xb7Leverage the POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 brand to generate leads and revenue for the Solar Division;\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xb7Leverage our investment in RGS 365\xe2\x84\xa2 customer-centric software for the POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 and Solar Divisions;\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xb7Expand our digital marketing program to generate customer leads while achieving our desired cost of acquisition;\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xb7Make available to our customers, additional third-party providers to finance customer acquisitions of our solar energy systems;\nand\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xb7Expand our network of authorized third-party installers.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWe compete with larger, better-financed firms for customers,\nemployees, and the services of third party financiers and installers and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be\nsuccessful in meeting our goals for increasing sales and revenue.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nRecent Developments\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nIn conjunction with our plans to position our company for future\nprofitable operations, we have:\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xb7Entered into an agreement for an up to $10.75 million convertible note and warrant offering in March 2018 to raise approximately\nup to $9.1 million after costs. We will receive gross proceeds of $5.0 million at closing and may receive up to $5.0 million more\nin the future upon prepayment of the Investor Notes, if any. It is our intent to use the proceeds from the 2018 Offering to obtain\nUL Certification for POWERHOUSE \xe2\x84\xa2 which will then require a $2 million payment to Dow, and (ii) initiate commercialization\nof POWERHOUSE \xe2\x84\xa2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xb7Launched a realignment of the Solar Division to reduce fixed cost structure below the gross profit line by 30% as compared\nto 2017 costs to lower the required amount of future revenue to achieve break-even, or better, operating results in the future.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xb7Raised net proceeds of $1.8 million from offerings of Class A common stock and warrants in January 2018.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n    32\n    \xc2\xa0\n    \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results\nof operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, or \xe2\x80\x9cGAAP.\xe2\x80\x9d The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that\naffect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on\nvarious other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making\njudgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may\ndiffer from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the following to be critical accounting\npolicies whose application have a material impact on our reported results of operations, and which involve a higher degree of complexity,\nas they require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nRevenue Recognition \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nFor sales of solar energy systems and components of less\nthan 100 kW, \xe2\x80\x9cresidential and small commercial customers\xe2\x80\x9d, we recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 605-25,\nRevenue Recognition\xe2\x80\x94Multiple-Element Arrangements, and ASC 605-10-S99, Revenue\nRecognition\xe2\x80\x94Overall\xe2\x80\x94SEC Materials. Revenue is recognized when (1)\xc2\xa0persuasive evidence of an arrangement\nexists, (2)\xc2\xa0delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (3)\xc2\xa0the sales price is fixed or determinable, and\n(4)\xc2\xa0collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Components are principally comprised of photovoltaic\npanels, inverters, and solar energy system mounting hardware. We recognize revenue when we install a solar energy system,\nprovided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Costs incurred on residential installations before the solar\nenergy systems are completed are deferred and included in other current assets as work in progress in the consolidated\nbalance sheet.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nFor those systems of 100 kW or greater, \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial customers,\xe2\x80\x9d\nwe recognize revenue according to ASC 605-35, Revenue Recognition\xe2\x80\x94Construction-Type and Production Type Contracts.\nRevenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis, based on the ratio of total costs incurred to date to total projected\ncosts. Provisions are made for the full amount of any anticipated losses on a contract-by-contract basis.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe assets \xe2\x80\x9cCosts in excess of billings\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cDeferred\ncosts on uncompleted contracts\xe2\x80\x9d represent costs incurred plus estimated earnings in excess of amounts billed on percentage-of-completion\nmethod contracts and costs incurred but deferred until recognition of the related contract revenue on completed-method contracts,\nrespectively. The liability \xe2\x80\x9cBillings in excess of costs on uncompleted contracts\xe2\x80\x9d represents billings in excess of\nrelated costs and earned profit on percentage-of-completion method contracts. We invoice commercial customers according to milestones\ndefined in their respective contracts. The prerequisite for billing is the completion of an application and certificate of payment\nform as per the contract, which is done after each month end.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nDeferred revenue consists of solar energy system installation\nfees billed to customers for projects which are not completed as of the balance sheet date.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated\nlosses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We estimate anticipated losses based on the expected\ncollectability of all of our accounts receivable, which takes into account collection history, the number of days past due, identification\nof specific customer exposure and current economic trends. When we determine a balance is uncollectible and no longer actively\npursue collection of the account, it is written off.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nInventory \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nInventory consists primarily of solar energy system components\n(such as photovoltaic modules and inverters) located at our warehouses and is stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out\nmethod) or market. We identify the inventory items to be written down for obsolescence based on the item\xe2\x80\x99s current sales\nstatus and condition. We write down discontinued or slow-moving inventories based on an estimate of the markdown to retail price\nneeded to sell through our current stock level of the inventories on a quarterly basis.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n    33\n    \xc2\xa0\n    \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWarranties\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWe warrant solar energy systems sold to customers for up to\nten years against defects in installation workmanship. The manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 warranties on the solar energy system components,\nwhich are typically passed through to the customers, typically have product warranty periods of 10 years and a limited performance\nwarranty period of 25 years. We generally provide for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized.\nWe also maintain specific warranty liabilities for large commercial customers included in discontinued operations. We assess the\naccrued warranty reserve regularly and adjust the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency\nwith the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations. During the\nsecond quarter of 2017, we concluded that it was appropriate to classify items in the statement of operations to conform with\noperating metrics reported to investors and the manner in which management evaluates financial performance and to classify warranty\nliability separately as current and non-current liabilities. Accordingly, we revised the classification of certain items to report\nitems in the statement of operations and balance sheet. These changes in classification did not change the previously reported\noperating income (loss) in the statement of operations, or cash generated (used) from operations in the statement of cash flows,\nor operating income (loss) for any business segment.\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nGoodwill and Purchased Intangibles \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWe review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for\nimpairment during the second quarter, or more frequently if a triggering event occurs between impairment testing dates.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nIntangible assets arising from business combinations, such as\nacquired customer contracts and relationships (collectively \xe2\x80\x9ccustomer relationships\xe2\x80\x9d), are initially recorded at fair\nvalue. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business\ncombination. Goodwill and purchased intangibles are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators\narise.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nUp-front POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 3.0 license payments when incurred,\ncosts to obtain UL Certification and legal costs to acquire the license and protect the underlying patents are initially capitalized\nand thereafter amortized to operations, upon achieving UL Certification, on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the\nlicense through 2034.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nDerivative Liabilities\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWe account for complex financial instruments including convertible\nnotes, convertible preferred stock, and warrants under ASC 815 and ASC 480.\xc2\xa0 We utilize third party appraisers to determine\nthe fair value of derivative liabilities embedded in complex financial instruments. For financial instruments accounted for as\nliabilities, we defer and amortize to operations costs incurred including the initial fair value of warrants issued and derivative\nliabilities. The issuance\xc2\xa0costs of financial instruments accounted for as equity are charged to additional paid in capital.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe extinguishment of financial instruments accounted for as\ndebt that are extinguished by issuance of common stock are recorded at the fair value of common stock issued at the date of issuance,\nwith any difference from the carrying value of the liability recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nShare-Based Compensation \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWe recognize compensation expense for share-based awards based\non the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant. We measure compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the\naward and recognize compensation expense based on the probable attainment of a specified performance condition for performance\nbased awards or over a service period for time based awards. We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair\nvalue for purposes of accounting and disclosures. In estimating this fair value, certain assumptions are used (see Note\xc2\xa08.\nShare-Based Compensation in Item 8 of this Annual Report), including the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rate,\ndividend yield, volatility and forfeiture rate. The use of different estimates for any one of these assumptions could have a material\nimpact on the amount of reported compensation expense.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n    34\n    \xc2\xa0\n    \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nIncome Taxes \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWe recognize income taxes under the asset and liability method.\nDeferred income taxes are recognized based on temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets\nand liabilities, using current enacted income tax rates and regulations. These differences will result in taxable income or deductions\nin future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively. Considerable judgment\nis required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset, including the utilization of a net operating\nloss carry-forward prior to its expiration, is more likely than not.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nResults of Operations \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nYear Ended December\xc2\xa031, 2017 Compared to Year Ended\nDecember\xc2\xa031, 2016 \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nContract revenue:\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nSale and installation of solar\nenergy systems. Sale and installation of solar energy system revenue decreased $2.7 million, or 16.1%, to $14 million\nduring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, from $16.7 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. During\nthe twelve months ended December 31, 2017, installations decreased 0.4 megawatts to 3.7 as compared to the 4.1 megawatts\ninstalled during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to slower sales in the beginning\nof the year and a weighted average 10% decline in our ASP. Additionally, the Rhode Island Renewal Energy Growth program\nreached its funding cap earlier than expected through April 1, 2018 which caused a delay in installations originally planned\nfor the fourth quarter of 2017. These projects are projected to be installed in the second quarter of 2018.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nService. Service revenue increased $0.4 million,\nor 53.5%, to $1.1 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 from $0.7 million during the twelve months ended December\n31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to a contract entered into with a third-party in the 4th quarter of 2016 to\nprovide service work on their existing customers.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nContract expenses:\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nInstallation of solar energy systems. Installation\nof solar energy system expenses decreased $1.2 million, or 8.2%, to $13.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31,\n2017, from $14.4 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, which corresponds to the reduction of installation\nrevenue during this same time comparison. We utilize gross margin percentage to measure performance utilizing an internal time\nreporting system allowing us to measure both total incurred contract expense and contract expense excluding construction crew\nidle time. \xc2\xa0For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, our residential segments gross margin without idle time declined\ndue to a 10% decline in the average selling price per watt exceeding the 2% decline in the costs of installation per watt.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nService. Service expense increased $0.5 million\nto $1.6 million, or 34.8% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, from $1.2 million during the twelve months ended December\n31, 2017. The increase is primarily due to the additional costs attributed to a contract entered into with a third-party in the\nfourth quarter of 2016 to provide service work on their existing customers.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nCustomer acquisition. Customer acquisition expense\nincreased $0.1 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, or 2.2%, to $5.9 million from $5.8 million during the\ntwelve months ended December 31, 2016. This increase is primarily attributable to our revenue growth strategy beginning during\nthe first quarter of 2017 resulting in increased hiring in our sales department, an increase in in digital lead development and\nan overall commitment to increased marketing efforts to reduce our cost of acquisition.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOperating expense. Operating expenses increased $3 million,\nor 39.9%, to $10.7 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $7.7 million during the twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in labor.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nLitigation and proxy contest expense. Litigation and proxy\ncontest expenses during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $1.5 million compared to $0.02 million during the twelve\nmonths ended December 31, 2016, primarily attributable to proxy contest expenses of $1.2 million in 2017. Our legal expenses may\nincrease in subsequent periods. See Note 5. Commitments and Contingencies.\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n    35\n    \xc2\xa0\n    \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nInterest expense. On September 14, 2016, we\nraised $2.8 million of convertible preferred stock that was accounted for as debt. By September 29, 2016, all of the\nconvertible preferred stock was converted to Class A common stock of the Company, extinguishing the debt, leaving a balance\nof $1,000 related to the 2016 Notes. As a result, there was effectively no interest expense  incurred during the twelve\nmonths ended December 31, 2017, resulting in a $2.8 million decrease from the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nDerivative and other. Derivative\nand other expenses was a $0.2 million gain for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 resulting from a fair market value change\nin the outstanding warrant liability. In comparison, there was a $2.6 million gain in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016\nprimarily resulting from a change in the fair market value of stock issued from the convertible note, offset by a decrease in\nthe derivative liability of the convertible note.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nDebt accretion expense and loss on extinguishment. During\nthe twelve months ended December 31, 2017, $0.5 million of loss on extinguishment was recorded related to the first quarter conversion\nof convertible notes, compared to $14 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. During the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2017, $0.4 million of principal and $0.1 million of accrued interest under the 2016 Notes were converted into 160,185\nshares of Class A common stock. As the trading price of our Class A common stock was higher at conversion than the effective conversion\nprice per share to the debt holder, we recorded a loss on extinguishment. During the third quarter of 2016 we raised $2.8 million\nof convertible preferred stock that was accounted for as debt. This debt was subsequently converted to Class A common stock and\nas the trading price of our stock was higher at conversion than the effective conversion price per share to the debt holder, a\nloss on extinguishment was recorded.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWe\nhave experienced recurring operating losses and negative cash flow from operations which have necessitated: (i) developing plans\nto grow revenue to generate positive cash flow and (ii) raising additional capital. No assurances can be given that we will be\nsuccessful with our plans to grow revenue for profitable operations. See Note 6. Shareholders Equity and Note 12. Subsequent\nEvents for transactions raising capital during 2017 and the first quarter of 2018.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOur plans to grow revenue are:\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xb7Invest in the POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 license by obtaining UL Certification for POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 3.0, a prerequisite for\n                                                                                                               commercialization of the product and, upon achieving UL Certification, manufacture, market and sell the POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 3.0\n                                                                                                               to roofing companies and new home builders;\n\n\n\xc2\xb7Leverage the POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 brand to generate leads and revenue for the Residential and Sunetric segments;\n\n\n\xc2\xb7Leverage our investment in RGS 365\xe2\x84\xa2 customer-centric software for the POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 and Solar Divisions;\n\n\n\xc2\xb7Expand our digital marketing program to generate customer leads while achieving our desired cost of acquisition;\n\n\n\xc2\xb7Make available to our customers additional third-party providers to finance customer acquisitions of our solar energy\n                                                                                                               systems; and\n\n\n\xc2\xb7Expand our network of authorized third-party installers.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\nDuring February 2018, we completed a strategic realignment to scale\nback our residential solar homeowner business. While we have made progress during 2017 in growing solar sales and backlog, growth\nhas not met initial expectations. The realignment reduced the number of outside sales personnel. We plan to maintain the areas\nof core competencies meeting expectations, such as its e-sales call center and commercial sales organization.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nUntil we are successful in implementing our plans to increase\nrevenue for profitable operations, we expect to have a cash outflow from operating activities. We expect to obtain UL certification\nfor POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 3.0 in 2018 and, if we determine to proceed at that time with the commercialization of POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2,\nwe expect to have cash outflow from operating activities for commercialization of POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2, including the remaining \xe2\x80\x9cInitial\nLicense\xe2\x80\x9d payment of the $2 million, prepayments with supply chain manufacturers and working capital as sales of the product\ncommence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n    36\n    \xc2\xa0\n    \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been\nprepared on a basis that assumes we will continue as a going concern and contemplates the continuity of operations, realization\nof assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. We have experienced a history\nof operating losses and have an accumulated deficit of approximately $200 million at December 31, 2017. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2017, we generated a net loss of approximately $17.7 million and we expect that we will continue to generate operating\nlosses until sales are increased and we subsequently recognize an increase in installation revenue. At December 31, 2017, our\nconsolidated cash balance was approximately $1.2 million.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nTo provide funds to grow our revenue, on March 30, 2018, we\nentered into the Securities Purchase Agreement for the 2018 Offering of up to $10.75 million in principal amount and $0.75 million\nof original issue discount of 2018 Notes with unaffiliated institutional investors. The 2018 Offering may result in gross proceeds\nof $10.0 million, before placement agent fees and other expenses associated with the transaction. We will receive $5 million of\nthe proceeds from the sale of the 2018 Notes at closing of the 2018 Offering. We also will receive Investor Notes from the investors\nof $5.0 million secured by cash and securities held in escrow. Investors are required to prepay the Investor Notes as they convert\ntheir Series B Notes issued in the 2018 Offering and, upon satisfaction of Equity Conditions and certain other conditions, upon\nthe occurrence of a specified mandatory prepayment event. The 2018 Notes will be convertible into Class A common stock and, if\nnot fully converted at maturity, we would seek to refinance a remaining balance at that time from either: (i) refinancing of the\nobligation with the issuers, (ii) a public offering of securities, or (iii) common stock warrant exercises including reducing the\nexercise price of common stock warrants to induce conversion. No assurances can be given that should a balance remain on the 2018\nNotes at maturity that we will be successful in meeting the obligation under the 2018 Notes. See Note 6. Shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 Equity\nfor information regarding our 2018 Offering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWe believe that without determining to proceed with the\ncommercialization of POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 3.0 we have sufficient capital resources for the ensuing 12 months. If we determine to\nproceed with commercialization of POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2 3.0, we will require additional capital which could be met from the Investor\nNotes. In the event capital from the Investor Notes are not received, we would seek obtaining the capital from other transactions\nsuch as a public offering of securities, and common stock warrant exercises including reducing the exercise price of common stock\nwarrants to induce conversion. No assurances can be given that should we determine to proceed with commercialization of POWERHOUSE\xe2\x84\xa2\n3.0, we will receive the additional capital necessary, either from the Investor Notes or an alternative transaction. Other than\nthe uncertainties regarding our ability to obtain additional funding, there are currently no known trends, demands, commitments,\nevents or uncertainties that are likely to materially affect our liquidity.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n201 Tariff \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2017, certain U.S.\nbased solar module manufacturers  filed a petition under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 (the \xe2\x80\x9c201 Tariff\xe2\x80\x9d)\nclaiming damages as a result of foreign manufacturers exporting lower priced photovoltaic modules into the U.S.\nand recommended the cost of foreign manufactured modules have a floor cost of $0.78 per watt, to be reduced over a\nfour-year period. Currently, we pay a weighted average cost less than the potential floor cost. On September 22, 2017, the\nU.S. International Trade Commission (\xe2\x80\x9cITC\xe2\x80\x9d) decided that the domestic industry had suffered serious harm due\nto imports. After additional public hearings, on October 31, 2017 the ITC provided remedy recommendations to the President\nof the United States which stated (i) that a tariff of 30% to 35% of the solar module cost should be applied and (ii) that\nany such tariff not apply to certain North American treaty partners such as Canada. Approximately 90% of the equipment\nwe purchase is from North American manufacturers.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nAs we sell systems months in advance of their installation and coupled\nwith our cash management approach to adhere to just-in-time procurement of materials, we determined there was sufficient exposure\nto installation margins to warrant bridge buying inventory at our current pricing and procuring panels in excess of current needs\ninto 2018. Accordingly, we have invested in our panel inventory, and as of December 31, 2017, have sufficient panel inventory for\nsubstantially all planned installations during the first quarter of 2018.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOn January 22, 2018, the Office of the President of the United\nStates approved in substantial form, recommendations by the ITC to impose a tariff of 30% on imports of solar cells and\nmodules under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, unless specifically excluded. Further, the provisions of the 201 Tariff\nare applicable to imported solar cells and modules from Canada, despite its being a member of the North American Free Trade\nAgreement. We have entered into a bi-annual purchase arrangement with  our North American panel provider to stabilize the\nprice per watt for panels. Accordingly, we do not believe the impact of the 201 Tariff will have a material effect on our\noperations.\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n    37\n    \xc2\xa0\n    \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nCash Flows\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe following table summarizes our primary sources (uses) of\ncash during the periods presented:\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n    \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n    2017\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n    2016\xc2\xa0\n\n    Net cash (used in) provided by:\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\n    Operating activities - continuing operations\xc2\xa0\n    $(16,533)\xc2\xa0\n    $(11,313)\n\n    Operating activities - discontinued operations\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa0498\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa0(981)\n\n    Operating activities\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa0(16,035)\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa0(12,294)\n\n    Investing activities\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa0(1,959)\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa0(50)\n\n    Financing activities\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa016,224\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa014,690\xc2\xa0\n\n    Net increase (decrease) in cash\xc2\xa0\n    $(1,770)\xc2\xa0\n    $2,346\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nContinuing Operations \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOperating activities. Cash outflow from operations for\nthe twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017 increased $5.2 million as compared to the twelve-month period ended December 31,\n2016. This increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in customer acquisition expense as contemplated our revenue growth strategy,\n(ii) an increase in inventory to secure solar panels at pre-201 Tariff pricing and (iii) an increase in litigation and proxy costs\nattributable to activist shareholder actions.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nInvesting activities. During the twelve months ended December\n31, 2017, we internally developed RGS 365\xe2\x84\xa2 customer-centric software at a cost of $0.5 million with $0.4 million paid during\nthe year. Additionally, expenditures related to our move of corporate headquarters resulted in cash outflows related to leasehold\nimprovements, furnishings and computer equipment of approximately $0.4 million.

Management\xc2\x92s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations.  MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW \n\xc2\xa0 Introduction \nPier 1 Imports, Inc. is the original global importer of home d\xc3\xa9cor and furniture. The Company directly imports merchandise from many countries, and sells a\nwide variety of decorative accessories, furniture, candles, housewares, gifts and seasonal products in its stores and through the Company\xc2\x92s website, Pier1.com. As of February\xc2\xa027, 2016, the Company operated 1,032 stores in the United States\nand Canada. The following discussion and analysis of financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto,\nwhich can be found in Item\xc2\xa08 of this report.  Over the past several years, the Company has transformed from a brick-and-mortar retailer to an\nomni-channel retailer, with the objective of seamless integration across stores, desktop and mobile devices. As part of its transformation to an omni-channel retailer the Company re-launched its e-Commerce capabilities including its website,\nPier1.com, during fiscal 2013. The Company\xc2\x92s focus through the \xc2\x911 Pier 1\xc2\x92 omni-channel strategy is to ensure that customers have an extraordinary experience, regardless of how they shop. By enabling the customer to interact with the\nbrand both in-store and online, the Company expects to maximize selling opportunities, extend brand reach and capture greater market share. The \xc2\x911 Pier 1\xc2\x92 strategy required investment in systems, distribution and fulfillment centers, call\ncenters, distribution network and store development, including new in-store selling tools such as swatch stations, computers and tablets. This strategy also includes a continuing commitment to return excess capital to shareholders through share\nrepurchases and cash dividends.  Fiscal 2015 capped a multi-year period of heavy investment for the Company in support of its transformation to an\nomni-channel retailer, including investment in systems, distribution and fulfillment centers, call centers, distribution network and store development. In fiscal 2016, the Company moderated capital expenditures by over one-third to $51.8 million,\nfrom $81.9 million in fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2016 capital expenditures were deployed toward infrastructure and technology development, including the customer data excellence initiative, supply chain upgrades, existing store improvements and 17\nnew store openings. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 are expected to be approximately $55 million to support ongoing investments in technology, stores and distribution centers.  Fiscal 2016 net sales increased 0.4% from the prior year and company comparable sales increased 0.7%. The increases were primarily attributable to the increase in e-Commerce sales, specifically increases in online\ntraffic, online conversion and average ticket compared to last year. During fiscal 2016, e-Commerce sales accounted for 16.1% of net sales compared to 11.1% in the previous fiscal year. E-Commerce sales were the primary driver of total sales growth\nin fiscal 2016, and the Company expects this trend to continue in fiscal 2017. A significant portion of e-Commerce sales touch the retail stores, either by originating on in-store PCs and tablets, or through in-store pick-up. As e-Commerce sales\nhave grown, and to the extent they continue to grow, delivery and fulfillment net costs have also increased and are expected to continue to increase. The Company began to leverage these costs as a percentage of fulfilled sales in fiscal 2016.\n Gross profit for fiscal 2016 was $705.0 million, or 37.3% of sales, compared to $768.5 million, or 40.8% of sales, in the same period last year, a\ndecline of 350 basis points. Merchandise margin (the result of adding back delivery and fulfillment net costs and store occupancy costs to gross profit \xc2\x97 see \xc2\x93Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\xc2\x94) was $1.046 billion\nfor fiscal 2016, or 55.3% of sales, compared to $1.100 billion, or 58.4% of sales for fiscal 2015. The year-over-year decline in merchandise margin as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to promotional and clearance activity and\ninventory-related inefficiencies within the Company\xc2\x92s distribution center network. Store occupancy costs during fiscal 2016 were leveraged slightly at 15.7% of sales, compared to 15.8% during fiscal 2015. \nOperating income for fiscal 2016 was 4.0% of sales, compared to 6.8% in fiscal 2015. Fiscal 2016 EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and\namortization \xc2\x97 see \xc2\x93Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\xc2\x94) was $125.2 million compared to $176.3 million in fiscal 2015. Net income for fiscal 2016 was $39.6 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, compared to $75.2\nmillion, or $0.82 per diluted share for fiscal 2015.  As the Company\xc2\x92s transition to an omni-channel retailer continues to mature, strategies and\nplans have been initiated and enhanced to drive meaningful top-line sales growth, restore merchandise margin and reduce costs across the organization. These include, but are not limited to: improving merchandise assortments; enhancing marketing\nprograms; optimizing the real \n \xc2\xa0 20\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0PIER 1 IMPORTS, INC.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc3\xaf\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02016 Form 10-K \n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ITEM\xc2\xa07.\xc2\xa0MANAGEMENT\xc2\x92S\xc2\xa0DISCUSSION\xc2\xa0AND\xc2\xa0ANALYSIS\xc2\xa0OF\xc2\xa0FINANCIAL\xc2\xa0CONDITION\xc2\xa0\nAND\xc2\xa0RESULTS\xc2\xa0OF\xc2\xa0OPERATIONS.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\n \nestate portfolio; reducing store and administrative expenses; improving supply chain efficiencies; managing inventory levels; improving promotional effectiveness; and moderating capital\nexpenditures. In the near-term, profitability will be challenged by a planned increase in media spending, expected continuing promotional and clearance activity and the cost of recent distribution center network inefficiencies. \nThe Company has set out several key guideposts by which to measure the Company\xc2\x92s performance in achieving its objectives, which are: \n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n1.\nBrand traffic, conversion and average ticket;  \xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n2.\nStores as sales and customer experience centers;  \xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n3.\nMerchandise margin and gross profit;  \xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n4.\nFulfillment and home delivery;  \xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n5.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses; and  \xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n6.\nCapital allocation.  The Company closed 33 stores, on a net basis,\nduring fiscal 2016. These closures are consistent with, and a part of, the real estate optimization plan previously announced by the Company. The real estate optimization plan includes three parts: (1)\xc2\xa0closure of approximately 100 stores over a\nthree to four fiscal-year period which commenced in fiscal 2016, primarily through natural lease expirations and relocations; (2)\xc2\xa0a more modest new store opening and relocation program; and (3)\xc2\xa0ongoing renegotiations of rent commitments.\n The Company entered into a $200 million Term Loan Facility. As of February\xc2\xa027, 2016, the Company had $197.0 million outstanding under its $200\nmillion Term Loan Facility. See \xc2\x93Liquidity and Capital Resources \xc2\x97 Revolving Credit Facility\xc2\x94 and \xc2\x93Liquidity and Capital Resources \xc2\x97 Term Loan Facility\xc2\x94 below for more information. \nAs of February\xc2\xa027, 2016, the Company had repurchased 12,669,435 shares of its common stock under the April 2014 program at a weighted average cost of $12.06\nper share for a total cost of $152.8 million, and $47.2 million remained available for further repurchases. Subsequent to year end, through April\xc2\xa020, 2016, under the April 2014 program, the Company utilized a total of $0.8\xc2\xa0million to\nrepurchase 120,000 shares of the Company\xc2\x92s common stock at a weighted average price per share of $7.01 and $46.3\xc2\xa0million remained available for further repurchases under that program. On April\xc2\xa013, 2016, subsequent to year end, the\nCompany announced a $0.07 per share quarterly cash dividend on the Company\xc2\x92s outstanding shares of common stock to shareholders of record on April\xc2\xa027, 2016, which is payable on May\xc2\xa011, 2016. \nOverview of Business  The Company has\nrevised the presentation of the reporting of credit and debit card fees (\xc2\x93Credit Card Fees\xc2\x94) for all periods presented. The Company previously reported Credit Card Fees as a reduction to net sales and has revised its presentation to report\nCredit Card Fees as a component of selling, general and administrative (\xc2\x93SG&A\xc2\x94) expenses. This revised presentation results in an immaterial increase to both net sales and SG&A expenses. There is no impact to operating income, net\nincome, the balance sheet or statement of cash flows.

In addition, orders placed online as\ndirect-to-customer sales (as defined below) were included in the calculation, as a result of direct-to-customer sales being active prior to the beginning of the preceding fiscal year. Remodeled or relocated stores are included if they meet specific\ncriteria. Those criteria include the following: the new store is within a specified distance serving the same market, no significant change in store size and no significant overlap or gap between the store closing and reopening. Such stores are\nincluded in the company comparable sales calculation in the first full month after the reopening. If a relocated or remodeled store does not meet the above criteria, it is excluded from the calculation until it meets the Company\xc2\x92s established\ndefinition as described above.  For the fiscal 2014 company comparable sales calculation, sales included in the calculation were determined in the same\nmanner as above, except that direct-to-customer sales were excluded because those sales did not meet the criteria for inclusion at that time.

Other sales consisted primarily of these wholesale sales and royalties received from Grupo Sanborns and gift card breakage.  Net sales during fiscal 2016 were $1.892 billion, an increase of 0.4%, from $1.885 billion in the prior fiscal year. Company comparable sales increased 0.7% for the year which was primarily the result of an\nincrease in online traffic, online conversion and average ticket compared to the prior year. The Company\xc2\x92s e-Commerce sales accounted for 16.1% of net sales for fiscal 2016 compared to 11.1% for fiscal 2015. E-Commerce sales are comprised of\nboth customer orders placed online which were shipped directly to the customer (\xc2\x93direct-to-customer\xc2\x94) and those picked up by the customer at a store location (\xc2\x93store pick-up\xc2\x94). \nSales at the Company\xc2\x92s Canadian stores are subject to fluctuations in currency conversion rates. The year-over-year decline in the value of the Canadian\nDollar, relative to the U.S.\xc2\xa0Dollar, negatively impacted net sales and company comparable sales by approximately 100 basis points in fiscal 2016. Sales on the Pier 1 rewards credit card comprised 34.2% of U.S. sales for the twelve months ended\nFebruary\xc2\xa027, 2016, compared to 32.4% last year.

Merchandise margin (the result of adding back delivery and fulfillment net\ncosts and store occupancy costs to gross profit \xc2\x97 see \xc2\x93Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\xc2\x94) was $1.046 billion for fiscal 2016, or 55.3% of sales, compared to $1.100 billion, or 58.4% of sales, for fiscal 2015. The\nyear-over-year decline in merchandise margin as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to promotional and clearance activity and inventory-related inefficiencies within the Company\xc2\x92s distribution center network. Delivery and\nfulfillment net costs for fiscal 2016 were $42.5 million, or 2.2% of sales, compared to $32.9 million, or 1.7% of sales, in fiscal 2015.

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 37.3% compared to an effective tax rate of 37.6% for fiscal 2015.

Company comparable sales increased 4.7% for fiscal 2015 which was the result of an increase in total brand\ntraffic, store and online conversion, and average ticket compared to fiscal 2014. The Company\xc2\x92s e-Commerce sales accounted for 11.1% of net sales for fiscal 2015 compared to 4.0% for fiscal 2014. E-Commerce sales are comprised of both customer\norders placed online which were shipped directly to the customer and those picked up by the customer at a store location.  The Company\xc2\x92s sales from\nCanadian stores are subject to fluctuations in currency conversion rates. These fluctuations offset the increase in company comparable sales by approximately 50 basis points in fiscal 2015. Sales on the Pier 1 rewards credit card comprised 32.4% of\nU.S. sales for fiscal 2015 compared to 30.4% in fiscal 2014.

At the end of fiscal 2015, there were 68 of these locations in Mexico and one in El Salvador. These locations are excluded from the table above. \nMerchandise Margin and Gross Profit  Gross\nprofit for fiscal 2015 was $768.5 million, or 40.8% of sales, compared to $765.3 million, or 42.7% of sales, in fiscal 2014, a decline of 190 basis points. Merchandise margin (the result of adding back delivery and fulfillment net costs and store\noccupancy costs to gross profit \xc2\x97 see \xc2\x93Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\xc2\x94) was $1.100 billion for fiscal 2015, or 58.4% of sales, compared to $1.068 billion, or 59.6%, for fiscal 2014. The decline in merchandise\nmargin as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to increased promotional activity in the first half of fiscal 2015 and incremental unplanned supply chain expenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 primarily related to the\ndistribution centers, which resulted from higher than normal inventory levels. Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 the Company refined its promotional strategy, utilizing a more targeted approach to promotions, with reduced frequency and\ndepth of all-Company coupons and a more balanced mix between full price and promotional selling. Store occupancy costs during fiscal 2015 were leveraged at 15.8% of sales, compared to 16.1% during fiscal 2014. \nSG&A Expenses, Depreciation and Operating Income  SG&A expenses were $594.9 million in fiscal 2015, compared to $550.9 million in fiscal 2014, an increase of $44.0 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses were 31.6% in fiscal 2015, compared to\n30.8% in fiscal 2014.

Depreciation for fiscal 2015 was $46.3 million compared to $38.9 million in fiscal 2014.

This increase was primarily the result of interest on borrowings under the Term Loan Facility and related expenses of\napproximately $8.4 million, partially offset by gains on the settlement of life insurance policies.  Income Taxes \nThe Company had an effective tax rate of 37.6% and recorded income tax expense of $45.2 million in fiscal 2015 compared to an effective tax rate of 38.4% and income\ntax expense of $67.1 million in fiscal 2014. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to certain non-recurring favorable permanent differences and other discrete items occurring during fiscal 2015. The decrease in income tax expense\ncompared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the Company\xc2\x92s lower income before income taxes in fiscal 2015.  Net Income and\nEBITDA  Net income in fiscal 2015 was $75.2 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, compared to $107.5 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, for fiscal\n2014. In fiscal 2015, non-GAAP adjusted net income excluding the after-tax effect of retirement related expenses for the Company\xc2\x92s former chief financial officer was $77.2 million, or $0.84 per diluted share. EBITDA for fiscal 2015 was $176.3\nmillion compared to $215.4 million in fiscal 2014. See \xc2\x93Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\xc2\x94 below.  RECONCILIATION OF\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  \xc2\xa0 The Company\nreports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

Contribution from operations represents gross profit, less compensation for operations (which includes store and customer service payroll) and operational expenses. EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization. Management believes merchandise margin, contribution from operations and EBITDA are meaningful indicators of the Company\xc2\x92s performance which provide useful information to investors regarding its financial\ncondition and results of operations. Management uses merchandise margin, contribution from operations and EBITDA, together with financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, to assess the Company\xc2\x92s operating performance, to enhance its\nunderstanding of core operating performance and to compare the Company\xc2\x92s operating performance to other retailers.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \n\xc2\xa0 The Company\xc2\x92s cash and cash equivalents totaled $115.2\nmillion at the end of fiscal 2016, an increase of $15.2 million from the fiscal 2015 year-end balance. The increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of $164.0 million, partially offset by the utilization of cash to fund the\nCompany\xc2\x92s capital investments and to return excess capital to shareholders, including $51.8 million for capital expenditures, $75.0 million to repurchase shares of the Company\xc2\x92s common stock under the April 2014 program and $23.7 million\nfor cash dividends.  The Company\xc2\x92s cash and cash equivalents totaled $100.1 million at the end of fiscal 2015, a decrease of $26.6 million from the\nfiscal 2014 year-end balance of $126.7 million. The decrease was primarily the result of the utilization of cash to support the Company\xc2\x92s growth plan and return of excess capital to shareholders, including $81.9 million for capital\nexpenditures, $185.5 million to repurchase shares of the Company\xc2\x92s common stock under the board approved share repurchase programs and cash dividends of $21.6 million. These expenditures were partially offset by cash provided by operating\nactivities of $65.7 million and net proceeds of $198.0 million from the closing of the Term Loan Facility.  Cash Flows from Operating\nActivities  Operating activities provided $164.0 million of cash in fiscal 2016, primarily as a result of net income adjusted for non-cash items as\nwell as a decrease in inventory. Inventory levels at the end of fiscal 2016 were $405.9 million, a decrease of $73.0 million, or 15%, from the end of fiscal 2015. The increase in cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2016 compared to\nfiscal 2015 is due to favorable changes in cash flows primarily related to inventories.  Operating activities provided $65.7 million of cash in fiscal\n2015, primarily as a result of $75.2 million of net income and a $26.3 million increase in accounts payable and other liabilities, primarily due to increased purchases of merchandise, offset by a $101.2\n\n \xc2\xa0 PIER 1\nIMPORTS, INC.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc3\xaf\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02016 Form\n10-K\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa027 \n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ITEM\xc2\xa07.\xc2\xa0MANAGEMENT\xc2\x92S\xc2\xa0DISCUSSION\xc2\xa0AND\xc2\xa0ANALYSIS\xc2\xa0OF\xc2\xa0FINANCIAL\xc2\xa0CONDITION\xc2\xa0\nAND\xc2\xa0RESULTS\xc2\xa0OF\xc2\xa0OPERATIONS.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n \xc2\xa0\n \nmillion increase in inventory. The increase in inventory over fiscal 2014 was primarily due to increased purchases during fiscal 2015 in anticipation of higher forecasted sales including\nincreased inventory for the Company\xc2\x92s special order program and additional purchases made due to the shift in the timing of Chinese New Year.  Cash Flows from Investing Activities  During fiscal 2016, the Company\xc2\x92s investing\nactivities used $51.7 million, compared to $83.3 million during fiscal 2015. Total capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 were $51.8 million, which were deployed toward infrastructure and technology development, supply chain upgrades, existing store\nimprovements and new store openings. The Company expects total capital expenditures to be approximately $55 million in fiscal 2017 to support ongoing investments in technology, stores and distribution centers. \nDuring fiscal 2015, the Company\xc2\x92s investing activities used $83.3 million, compared to $70.2 million during fiscal 2014. Total capital expenditures in fiscal\n2015 were $81.9 million, which were deployed toward the opening of 30 new stores, new merchandise fixtures for existing stores, other leasehold improvements, and technology and infrastructure initiatives, including enhancements to the omni-channel\nplatform. The Company also invested in its distribution network and completed its second fulfillment center in Columbus, Ohio.  Cash\nFlows from Financing Activities  Financing activities for fiscal 2016 used $97.2 million, primarily resulting from cash outflows of $75.0 million for\nrepurchases of the Company\xc2\x92s common stock pursuant to the April 2014 program and the payment of quarterly cash dividends of $0.07 per share per quarter for each quarter of fiscal 2016, totaling $23.7 million. See \xc2\x93Share Repurchase\nProgram\xc2\x94 below for more information.  Financing activities for fiscal 2015 used $9.0 million of cash, primarily related to cash outflows of\n$185.5 million for repurchases of the Company\xc2\x92s common stock pursuant to the April 2014 program and the share repurchase program approved by the Board in October of 2013, which included $11.6 million for shares repurchased in fiscal 2014 that\nsettled in fiscal 2015, and the payment of quarterly cash dividends of $0.06 per share per quarter for each quarter of fiscal 2015, totaling $21.6 million. This utilization of cash was offset by $198.0 million of net proceeds from borrowings under\nthe Term Loan Facility. See \xc2\x93Revolving Credit Facility,\xc2\x94 \xc2\x93Term Loan Facility\xc2\x94 and \xc2\x93Share Repurchase Program\xc2\x94 below for more information.  Revolving Credit Facility  The Company completed a second amendment to its Revolving Credit\nFacility in April of 2014, in order to allow additional borrowings under the Term Loan Facility that closed at the same time. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured primarily by merchandise inventory and third-party credit card receivables and\ncertain related assets on a first priority basis and is secured on a second lien basis by substantially all other assets of certain of the Company\xc2\x92s subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. Credit extensions under the Revolving Credit\nFacility are limited to the lesser of $350.0 million or the amount of the calculated borrowing base, which was $341.4 million as of February\xc2\xa027, 2016. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company had no cash borrowings and $37.6 million in\nletters of credit and bankers\xc2\x92 acceptances outstanding, with $303.8 million remaining available for cash borrowings, all as of February\xc2\xa027, 2016.  Term Loan Facility  The Term Loan Facility matures on April\xc2\xa030, 2021, and is secured by a\nsecond lien on all assets subject to a first lien under the Revolving Credit Facility and a first lien on substantially all other assets of certain of the Company\xc2\x92s subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. At the Company\xc2\x92s option,\nborrowings under the Term Loan Facility will bear interest, payable quarterly or, if earlier, at the end of each interest period, at either (a)\xc2\xa0the LIBOR rate (as defined in the Term Loan Facility) subject to a 1% floor plus 350 basis points\nper year or (b)\xc2\xa0the base rate (as defined in the Term Loan Facility) subject to a 2% floor plus 250 basis points per year. As of February\xc2\xa027, 2016, the Company had $197.0 million outstanding under the Term Loan Facility with a carrying\nvalue of $192.9 million, net of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs. The proceeds of the loan were used for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs, capital expenditures, and share repurchases and dividends permitted\nunder the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility is subject to quarterly amortization of principal equal to 0.25% of the original aggregate principal amount of the loans, with the balance due at final maturity. The Company is subject to an\nannual excess cash flow repayment requirement, as defined in the facility. At the Company\xc2\x92s option, and subject to the requirements and provisions of the Term Loan Facility, the Company can prepay borrowings under the Term Loan Facility at any\ntime. The fair value of the Term Loan Facility was approximately $188.1 million as of February\xc2\xa027, 2016, which was measured at fair value using the quoted market price. The Term Loan Facility was classified as Level 2 based on the frequency and\nvolume of trading for which the price \n \xc2\xa0 28\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0PIER 1 IMPORTS, INC.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc3\xaf\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02016 Form 10-K \n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ITEM\xc2\xa07.\xc2\xa0MANAGEMENT\xc2\x92S\xc2\xa0DISCUSSION\xc2\xa0AND\xc2\xa0ANALYSIS\xc2\xa0OF\xc2\xa0FINANCIAL\xc2\xa0CONDITION\xc2\xa0\nAND\xc2\xa0RESULTS\xc2\xa0OF\xc2\xa0OPERATIONS.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\n \nwas readily available.

The Term Loan Facility includes restrictions on the Company\xc2\x92s ability to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends on, or redeem or repurchase shares of the Company\xc2\x92s\ncapital stock, make certain acquisitions or investments, materially change the business of the Company, incur or permit to exist certain liens, enter into transactions with affiliates or sell the Company\xc2\x92s assets to, or merge or consolidate\nwith or into, another company, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The Term Loan Facility does not require the Company to comply with any financial maintenance covenants, but contains certain customary representations and warranties,\naffirmative covenants and provisions relating to events of default. The Term Loan Facility provides for incremental facilities, subject to certain conditions, including the meeting of certain leverage ratio requirements as defined therein, to the\nextent such facilities exceed an incremental $200.0 million.

The table above excludes certain executory contracts for goods and services that tend to be recurring in nature and similar in amount year over\nyear. \n\n\n(2)\xc2\xa0\n The Company also has an outstanding standby letter of credit totaling $9.7 million related to the Company\xc2\x92s industrial revenue bonds. This amount is\nexcluded from the table above as it is not incremental to the Company\xc2\x92s total outstanding commitments. \n\n\n(3)\xc2\xa0\n The interest rates on the Company\xc2\x92s industrial revenue bonds are variable and reset weekly. The estimated interest payments included in the table were\ncalculated based upon the rate in effect at fiscal 2016 year end and exclude fees for the related standby letter of credit, as these fees are included in interest and related fees on the Revolving Credit Facility. \n\n\n(4)\xc2\xa0\n Represents estimated commitment fees for trade and standby letters of credit, and unused balance fees on the Company\xc2\x92s Revolving Credit Facility.

The estimated interest payments included in the table were calculated based upon the\nrate in effect at fiscal 2016 year end. Currently a principal reduction in the amount of $0.5 million is made on the last day of each calendar quarter, therefore the principal is reduced by $2.0 million annually. \n\n\n(6)\xc2\xa0\n Other obligations include various commitments including the Company\xc2\x92s liability under its unfunded retirement plans. See Note 5 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company\xc2\x92s employee benefit plans. \n\n\n(7)\xc2\xa0\n Excluded from this table, but recorded on the Company\xc2\x92s balance sheet, is the portion of reserves for uncertain tax positions of $1.0 million for which\nthe Company is not reasonably able to estimate when or if cash settlement with the respective taxing authority will occur.  The\nCompany has an umbrella trust, currently consisting of five sub-trusts, which was established for the purpose of setting aside funds to be used to settle certain benefit plan obligations. Two of the sub-trusts are restricted to satisfy obligations\nto certain participants in the Company\xc2\x92s supplemental retirement plans. The assets of the two sub-trusts consisted of interest bearing investments of less than $0.1 million at both February\xc2\xa027, 2016 and February\xc2\xa028, 2015, and were\nincluded in other noncurrent assets. The remaining three sub-trusts are restricted to meet the funding requirements of the Company\xc2\x92s non-qualified deferred compensation plans. These trusts\xc2\x92 assets are included in other noncurrent assets\nand are comprised of investments and life insurance policies. The investments totaled $9.9 million and $10.6 million at February\xc2\xa027, 2016 and February\xc2\xa028, 2015, respectively. The investments were held primarily in mutual funds and are\nstated at fair value. These sub-trusts also own and are the beneficiaries of life insurance policies on the lives of former key executives. These policies are stated at fair value. The cash surrender value of the policies was approximately $5.9\nmillion and $5.7 million as of February\xc2\xa027, 2016 and February\xc2\xa028, 2015, respectively, and the death benefit was approximately $11.4 million and $11.3 million, respectively.  In addition, the Company owns and is the beneficiary of a number of insurance policies on the lives of former key executives that were unrestricted as to use at the end of fiscal 2016. The cash surrender value of\nthe unrestricted policies was approximately $13.4 million and $13.1 million at February\xc2\xa027, 2016 and February\xc2\xa028, 2015, respectively, and was included in other noncurrent assets. These policies had a death benefit of approximately $20.1\nmillion and $19.9 million as of February\xc2\xa027, 2016 and February\xc2\xa028, 2015, respectively. At the discretion of the Company\xc2\x92s Board, contributions of cash or unrestricted life insurance policies may be made to one or more of the\nsub-trusts.  Sources of Working Capital  The Company\xc2\x92s sources of working capital for fiscal 2016 were primarily cash from operations and the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company has a variety of sources for liquidity, which include available cash\nbalances and borrowings against the Company\xc2\x92s Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility. The Company\xc2\x92s current plans for fiscal 2017 include a capital expenditure plan slightly higher than fiscal 2016 and continuation of cash\ndividends and repurchases of the Company\xc2\x92s common stock. The Company does not presently anticipate any other significant cash outflows in fiscal 2017 other than those discussed herein or those occurring in the normal course of business.\n\n \xc2\xa0 30\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0PIER 1 IMPORTS, INC.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc3\xaf\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02016 Form 10-K \n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ITEM\xc2\xa07.\xc2\xa0MANAGEMENT\xc2\x92S\xc2\xa0DISCUSSION\xc2\xa0AND\xc2\xa0ANALYSIS\xc2\xa0OF\xc2\xa0FINANCIAL\xc2\xa0CONDITION\xc2\xa0\nAND\xc2\xa0RESULTS\xc2\xa0OF\xc2\xa0OPERATIONS.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\n The Company\xc2\x92s key drivers of cash flows are sales, management of inventory levels, vendor payment terms,\nmanagement of expenses and capital expenditures. The Company\xc2\x92s focus remains on managing inventory purchases, managing those inventories, and continuing to evolve the Company\xc2\x92s merchandise offerings while also maximizing its revenues,\nseeking out ways to make its cost base more efficient and effective and preserving liquidity. While there can be no assurance that the Company will sustain positive cash flows or profitability over the long-term, given the Company\xc2\x92s cash\nposition and the various liquidity options available, the Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to fund its obligations, including debt-related payments, capital expenditure requirements, cash dividends and share repurchases through fiscal\n2017.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS \n\xc2\xa0 Other than the operating leases, letters of credit and\npurchase obligations discussed above, the Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES \n\xc2\xa0 The preparation of the Company\xc2\x92s consolidated financial\nstatements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the use of estimates that affect the reported value of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates are based on historical\nexperience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for the Company\xc2\x92s conclusions. The Company continually evaluates the information used to make these estimates\nas the business and the economic environment changes. Historically, actual results have not varied materially from the Company\xc2\x92s estimates. The Company does not currently anticipate a significant change in its assumptions related to these\nestimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company\xc2\x92s significant accounting policies can be found in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The policies and\nestimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to the Company\xc2\x92s financial statements. Unless specifically\naddressed below, the Company does not believe that its critical accounting policies are subject to market risk exposure that would be considered material, and, as a result, has not provided a sensitivity analysis. The use of estimates is pervasive\nthroughout the consolidated financial statements, but the accounting policies and estimates considered most critical are as follows:  Revenue\nrecognition \xc2\x97 Revenue is recognized upon customer receipt or delivery for retail sales. A reserve has been established for estimated merchandise returns based upon historical experience and other known factors. Should actual returns differ\nfrom the Company\xc2\x92s estimated reserve for merchandise returns, revisions to the estimate may be required. The Company\xc2\x92s revenues are reported net of discounts and returns, net of sales tax, and include wholesale sales and royalties. Amounts\nbilled to customers for shipping and handling are included in net sales.  Gift cards \xc2\x97 Revenue associated with gift cards is recognized when\nmerchandise is sold and a gift card is redeemed as payment. Gift card breakage is estimated and recorded as income based upon an analysis of the Company\xc2\x92s historical data and expected trends in redemption patterns and represents the remaining\nunused portion of the gift card liability for which the likelihood of redemption is remote. If actual redemption patterns vary from the Company\xc2\x92s estimates or if regulations change, actual gift card breakage may differ from the amounts\nrecorded. For all periods presented, estimated gift card breakage was recognized 30 months after the original issuance.  Inventories \xc2\x97 The\nCompany\xc2\x92s inventory is comprised of finished merchandise and is stated at the lower of weighted average cost or market value. Cost is calculated based upon the actual landed cost of an item at the time it is received in the Company\xc2\x92s\ndistribution center using vendor invoices, the cost of warehousing and transporting merchandise to the stores and other direct costs associated with purchasing merchandise. Carrying values of inventory are analyzed and, to the extent that the cost\nof inventory exceeds the expected selling prices less reasonable costs to sell, provisions are made to reduce the carrying amount of the inventory. The Company reviews its inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and uses\nmerchandise markdowns to sell such merchandise. Markdowns reduce the retail price of such slow-moving merchandise as needed. Since the determination of carrying values of inventory involves both estimation and judgment with regard to market values\nand reasonable costs to sell, differences in these estimates could result in ultimate valuations that differ from the recorded asset. The majority of inventory purchases and commitments are made in U.S. dollars in order to limit the Company\xc2\x92s\nexposure to foreign currency fluctuations.  The Company recognizes known inventory losses, shortages and damages when incurred and maintains a reserve\nfor estimated shrinkage since the last physical count, when actual shrinkage was recorded. The amount of the reserve is estimated based on historical experience from the results of its physical inventories. Inventory is physically counted at\nsubstantially all locations at least once in each 12-month period, at which time actual results are reflected in the financial statements. Physical counts were taken \n \xc2\xa0 PIER 1\nIMPORTS, INC.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc3\xaf\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02016 Form\n10-K\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa031 \n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ITEM\xc2\xa07.\xc2\xa0MANAGEMENT\xc2\x92S\xc2\xa0DISCUSSION\xc2\xa0AND\xc2\xa0ANALYSIS\xc2\xa0OF\xc2\xa0FINANCIAL\xc2\xa0CONDITION\xc2\xa0\nAND\xc2\xa0RESULTS\xc2\xa0OF\xc2\xa0OPERATIONS.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n \xc2\xa0\n \nat substantially all stores and distribution and fulfillment centers during each period presented in the financial statements. Although inventory shrinkage rates have not fluctuated significantly\nin recent years, should actual rates differ from the Company\xc2\x92s estimates, revisions to the inventory shrinkage expense may be required. \nInsurance provision \xc2\x97 The Company maintains insurance for workers\xc2\x92 compensation and general liability claims with deductibles of $1.0 million per\noccurrence. The liability recorded for such claims is determined by estimating the total future claims cost for events that occurred prior to the balance sheet date. The estimates consider historical claims loss development factors as well as\ninformation obtained from and projections made by the Company\xc2\x92s broker, actuary, insurance carriers and third party claims administrators. The recorded liabilities for workers\xc2\x92 compensation and general liability claims include claims\noccurring in prior years but not yet settled and reserves for fees.  The assumptions made in determining the above estimates are reviewed monthly and the\nliability adjusted accordingly as new facts are developed. Changes in circumstances and conditions affecting the assumptions used in determining the liabilities could cause actual results to differ from the Company\xc2\x92s recorded amounts.\n Defined benefit plans \xc2\x97 The Company maintains supplemental retirement plans for certain of its current and former executive officers. These\nplans provide that upon death, disability, reaching retirement age or certain termination events, a participant will receive benefits based on highest compensation, years of service and years of plan participation. The benefit costs are dependent\nupon numerous factors, assumptions and estimates. Benefit costs may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, compensation rates or retirement dates used to determine the projected benefit obligation.\nAdditionally, changes made to the provisions of the plans may impact current and future benefit costs.  Stock-based compensation \xc2\x97 The\nCompany\xc2\x92s stock-based compensation relates to stock options, restricted stock awards and director deferred stock units. Accounting guidance requires all companies to measure and recognize compensation expense at an amount equal to the fair\nvalue of share-based payments granted. Compensation expense is recognized for any unvested stock option awards and restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis or ratably over the requisite service period. Stock option exercise prices equal the\nfair market value of the shares on the date of the grant. The fair value of stock options is calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For time-based and certain performance-based restricted stock awards, compensation expense is\nmeasured and recorded using the closing price of the Company\xc2\x92s stock on the date of grant. If the date of grant for stock options or restricted stock awards occurs on a day when the Company\xc2\x92s stock is not traded, the closing price on the\nlast trading day before the date of grant is used. The time-based awards typically vest ratably over the requisite service period provided that the participant is employed on the vesting date. A portion of the performance-based shares vests upon the\nCompany satisfying certain performance targets. Performance-based shares are considered granted for accounting purposes on the date the performance targets are set. The Company records compensation expense for these awards with a performance\ncondition when it is probable that the condition will be achieved. The compensation expense ultimately recognized, if any, related to these awards will equal the grant date fair value for the number of shares for which the performance condition has\nbeen satisfied. The remaining performance-based shares are based on a market condition and may vest if certain annual equivalent returns of total shareholder return targets are achieved in comparison to a peer group. The fair value for these\nperformance-based shares was determined using a lattice valuation model in accordance with accounting guidelines, and will be expensed on a straight-line basis over the performance period.  Income taxes \xc2\x97 The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial\nreporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the\nCompany\xc2\x92s consolidated balance sheets and are classified as noncurrent. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized. In assessing\nthe need for a valuation allowance, all available evidence is considered including past operating results, estimates of future income and tax planning strategies. The Company is subject to income tax in many jurisdictions, including the United\nStates, various states, provinces, localities and foreign countries, for which the Company records estimated reserves for unrecognized tax benefits for both domestic and foreign income tax issues. At any point in time, multiple tax years are subject\nto audit by these various jurisdictions. The timing of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. If different assumptions had been used, the Company\xc2\x92s tax expense or benefit,\nassets and liabilities could have varied from recorded amounts. If actual results differ from estimated results or if the Company adjusts these assumptions in the future, the Company may need to adjust its reserves for unrecognized tax benefits or\nits deferred tax assets or liabilities, which could impact its effective tax rate.  IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES \n\xc2\xa0 Inflation has not had a significant impact on the operations\nof the Company during the preceding three years. However, the Company\xc2\x92s management cannot be certain of the effect inflation may have on the Company\xc2\x92s operations in the future. \n \xc2\xa0 32\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0PIER 1 IMPORTS, INC.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc3\xaf\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02016 Form 10-K \n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ITEM\xc2\xa07A.\xc2\xa0QUANTITATIVE\xc2\xa0AND\xc2\xa0QUALITATIVE\xc2\xa0DISCLOSURES\xc2\xa0ABOUT\xc2\xa0MARKET\xc2\xa0RISK.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n \xc2\xa0\n Item\xc2\xa07A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market\nRisk.  Market risks relating to the Company\xc2\x92s operations result primarily from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The\nCompany has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments, does not use them for trading purposes and is not a party to any leveraged derivatives. Collectively, the Company\xc2\x92s exposure to market risk factors is not significant and\nhas not materially changed from February\xc2\xa028, 2015.  Foreign Currency Risk \n\xc2\xa0 Though the majority of the Company\xc2\x92s inventory purchases\nare made in U.S. dollars in order to limit its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, the Company, periodically, enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The Company uses such contracts to hedge exposures to changes in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates associated with purchases denominated in foreign currencies, primarily euros. The Company operates stores in Canada and is subject to fluctuations in currency conversion rates related to those operations. On occasion, the\nCompany may consider utilizing contracts to hedge its exposure associated with repatriation of funds from its Canadian operations. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives are included in the Company\xc2\x92s consolidated statements of operations\nas such contracts are not designated as hedges under the applicable accounting guidance. Forward contracts that hedge merchandise purchases generally have maturities not exceeding six months. Changes in the fair value and settlement of these\nforwards are included in cost of sales and the impact was immaterial. At February\xc2\xa027, 2016, there were no outstanding contracts to hedge exposure associated with the Company\xc2\x92s merchandise purchases denominated in foreign currencies or the\nrepatriation of Canadian funds.  Interest Rate Risk \n\xc2\xa0 The Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates\nby optimizing the use of variable rate debt. The expected interest rate exposure on the Company\xc2\x92s Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan Facility and industrial revenue bonds is based upon variable interest rates and therefore is affected by\nchanges in market interest rates. As of February\xc2\xa027, 2016, the Company had $202.3 million (net of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs) in long-term debt outstanding related to its Term Loan Facility and industrial revenue bonds and no\ncash borrowings outstanding on its Revolving Credit Facility. The Company expects to pay interest totaling approximately $9.0 million per year on the Term Loan Facility based upon rates in effect at the end of fiscal 2016. A hypothetical 100 basis\npoint increase in the interest rate would result in approximately $2.0 million of additional interest expense under the Term Loan Facility. \n \xc2\xa0 PIER 1\nIMPORTS, INC.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc3\xaf\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02016 Form\n10-K\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa033 \n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents', shape=(), dtype=string)




























tf.Tensor(b'Item\n7. Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe\nfollowing discussion highlights the Company\'s business activities during fiscal years 2014 and 2013.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOverview\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe\nCompany is not expected to generate revenue until after the development of the Omagine Project in Oman is well underway. The Company\nwill need to generate revenue in order to attain profitability.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nAs\nthe development program for the Omagine Project becomes more detailed and as the planning and design processes progress, the estimates\nof construction and development costs have and will become proportionately more accurate. LLC presently expects, based on the\ncurrent assumptions underlying its updated development program, that the development costs (including the costs for design, construction,\nprogram management and construction management) for the Omagine Project will be between $2.1 and $2.5 billion dollars.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe\ncosts of labor and materials as well as the selling prices and market absorption rates of new residential and commercial properties\nremain somewhat volatile in Oman and accurate forecasts for such future costs, selling prices or market absorption rates cannot\nbe made at this time. (See: \xe2\x80\x9cMarket Conditions\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSales and Marketing\xe2\x80\x9d, above).\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nLLC\nnevertheless presently expects, based on current assumptions and market activity that such residential selling prices during the\nOmagine Project\xe2\x80\x99s planned multiple sales releases beginning in early 2016 will be at least equal to the prices that are\npresently budgeted by LLC.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nIn\ntheir opinion on our 2014 audited financial statements contained in this report, our auditors have expressed substantial doubt\nabout our ability to continue as a going concern. Although we have entered into the 2014 SEDA and have recently raised additional\ncapital via private placements of restricted Common Shares, we estimate that, absent our obtaining any additional working capital,\nwe can continue as a going concern for approximately between eleven and fifteen months from the date of this report. On October\n2, 2014, 250,000 Tempest Warrants were exercised for proceeds to Omagine of $327,500. In November 2014, Omagine sold an aggregate\nof 422,321 restricted Common Shares to investors for aggregate proceeds to Omagine of $845,000. In March 2015, Omagine sold an\naggregate of 206,281 restricted Common Shares to investors for aggregate proceeds to Omagine of $220,000.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n    24\n    \xc2\xa0\n    \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOur\nsingle most important strategic objective for the past many years was achieved when the DA was signed by Omagine LLC and the Government\nof Oman on October 2, 2014. Our foregoing estimate of between eleven and fifteen months is based on (i) our current cash balances,\n(ii) assuming no effect on the Company\xe2\x80\x99s financing prospects from having signed a multi-billion dollar transaction, (iii)\nassuming no sales of Common Stock pursuant to the 2014 SEDA, private placements or exercise of Warrants, and (iv) our extensive\nprior experience in carefully managing our cash outlays. Although we have never failed over the past ten years to obtain the cash\nresources sufficient to fund our ongoing operations, we cannot guarantee that such financing for our continuing operations will\nbe available in the future.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nRights\nOffering and Warrant Distribution\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nIn\n2012 Omagine conducted a Rights Offering and Warrant Distribution pursuant to which Omagine (i) sold 1,014,032 Common Shares for\naggregate proceeds of $1,267,540 of which $731,639 was paid in cash and $535,901 was paid via the satisfaction of debt, and (ii)\ndistributed 6,422,124 Strategic Warrants at no charge to its shareholders. (See: \xe2\x80\x9cResults of Operations \xe2\x80\x93 Fiscal Year\nended December 31, 2014 vs. Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2013 - Liquidity and Capital Resources \xe2\x80\x93 Rights Offering and\nWarrant Distribution\xe2\x80\x9d below).\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nCritical\nAccounting Policies\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOur\nfinancial statements attached hereto for the fiscal years 2014 and 2013 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States. The fiscal year 2014 financial statements have been audited by Omagine\'s independent\ncertified public accountants. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of\nthe financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The policies discussed\nbelow are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places\nthe most significant demands on management\'s judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect\nof matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following\nparagraphs. For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the best\nestimates routinely require adjustment.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n    \xe2\x97\x8f\n    \n    Revenue\n    Recognition. The method of revenue recognition at LLC will be determined by management when and if it becomes likely that\n    LLC will begin generating revenue.\n\n    \xc2\xa0\n    \xc2\xa0\n\n    \xe2\x97\x8f\n    Valuation\n    Allowance for Deferred U.S. Tax Assets. The carrying value of deferred U.S. tax assets assumes that Omagine will not be able\n    to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize such deferred tax assets, based on management\'s prior estimates and\n    assumptions. Now that the DA has been signed, management will re-evaluate such estimates and assumptions.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe\nCompany plans to continue its focus on real-estate development, entertainment and hospitality ventures and on developing, building,\nowning and operating tourism and residential real-estate development projects, primarily in the MENA Region. The Company presently\nconcentrates the majority of its efforts on the tourism and real estate development business of LLC in Oman and in particular\non the Omagine Project.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nResults\nof Operations :\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nFiscal\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2013\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe\nCompany did not generate any revenue or incur any cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. The Company is\nrelying on Omagine LLC\'s operations for the Company\'s future revenue generation. Management is presently examining other possible\nsources of revenue for the Company which, subject to the Development Agreement being executed by Omagine LLC and the Government\non October 2, 2014, may be added to the Company\xe2\x80\x99s operations.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nTotal\nselling, marketing, general and administrative operating expenses (\xe2\x80\x9cSG&A Expenses\xe2\x80\x9d) were $6,724,540 during the\nyear ended December 31, 2014 compared to $2,630,555 during the year ended December 31, 2013. This $4,093,985 (156%) increase in\nSG&A Expenses was attributable to the following expense categories: officers and directors\xe2\x80\x99 compensation, including\nstock based compensation ($2,251,163), consulting fees including stock based compensation ($1,412,318), stock-based commitment\nfees ($150,000), travel ($136,296), other selling, general and administrative costs ($69,985), professional fees, including stock\nbased compensation ($61,298), and occupancy costs ($12,485).\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe\nCompany sustained a net loss of $6,772,260 for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a net loss of $2,640,590 for the year\nended December 31, 2013. This $4,131,670 (156%) increase in the Company\'s net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared\nto its net loss for the year ended December 31, 2013 was principally attributable to the $4,093,985 increase in SG&A Expenses\nmentioned above (with 55% of the increase attributable to compensation and stock based compensation) a $24,951 increase in interest\nexpense, $31,031 increase in amortization of debt discount and a $18,297 increase in net loss attributable to minority shareholders\nof Omagine LLC.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n    25\n    \xc2\xa0\n    \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe Company incurred net losses of $6,772,260 and $2,640,590 in\nthe years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company had net positive\ncash flow of $1,093,596 resulting from the positive cash flow of $2,471,600 from its financing activities being offset by the\nnegative cash flow of $1,374,210 from its operating activities and $3,434 from investing activities. Financing activities during\nthe year ended December 31, 2014 consisted of sales by Omagine, Inc. of shares of its Common Stock for proceeds of $1,797,100,\nproceeds from the exercise of Common Stock Purchase Warrants of $663,500 and proceeds from the issuance of a new note payable\nto YA Global Master SPV, Ltd. of $461,000, less an aggregate $450,000 repayment of notes payable to YA ($175,000 paid on the original\n$200,000 note and the first four monthly installments totaling $275,000 paid on the $500,000 note).\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe Company had capital expenditures for the year ended December\n30, 2014 of $3,434.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nAt December 31, 2014, the Company had $1,119,459 in current assets,\nconsisting of $1,113,679 of cash and $5,780 of prepaid expenses. The Company\'s current liabilities at December 31, 2014 totaled\n$1,640,197 consisting of $370,429 of convertible notes payable and accrued interest, $214,778 of notes payable and accrued interest,\n$417,068 of accounts payable and accrued expenses and $637,922 in accrued officers\xe2\x80\x99 payroll. At December 31, 2014, the Company\nhad a working capital deficit of $520,738 compared to a working capital deficit of $1,572,905 at December 31, 2013. Fifty-three\npercent (53%) of the $1,640,197 of current liabilities at December 31, 2014 ($865,331) is due and owing to officers and/or directors.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe $1,052,167 decrease in the Company\'s working capital deficit\nat December 31, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013 is attributable to a $4,495 decrease in prepaid items, a $1,093,956 increase\nin cash, and a $37,294 increase in current liabilities. The Company\xe2\x80\x99s liabilities at December 31, 2014 increased compared\nto December 31, 2013 due to increases of $52,838 in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, $51,652\nincreases in notes payable and accrued interest and $22,494 in accrued interest on convertible notes payable offset by decreases\nof $89,690 in accrued officers payroll.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nAs discussed in Note 2 to such consolidated financial statements,\nthe Company\'s present financial condition raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management\'s\nplans in regard to this matter are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating\nto the recoverability and classification of recorded assets or the amounts or classification of liabilities that might be necessary\nin the event the Company cannot continue in existence. The continued existence of the Company is dependent upon its ability to\nobtain additional financing, execute its business plan and attain profitable operations.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOmagine LLC\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nLLC presently has limited and strained\nresources.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOmagine and JOL invested the 20,000\nOmani Rial ($52,000) OMAG Initial Equity Investment into LLC in 2009. A further 130,000 Omani Rial ($338,000) aggregate investment\nwas made into LLC by Omagine and the New Shareholders pursuant to the Shareholder Agreement and LLC is presently capitalized at\n150,000 Omani Rials ($390,000). Expenses incurred to date have depleted LLC\xe2\x80\x99s resources and as of the date hereof Omagine\nhas advanced to LLC 110,000 Omani Rials ($286,000) of the OMAG Final Equity Investment in order to maintain LLC\xe2\x80\x99s liquidity.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOmagine will make the 210,000 Omani\nRial ($546,000) OMAG Final Investment into LLC on a date between the date hereof and the Financing Agreement Date. The New Shareholders\nare obligated to make the 26,628,125 Omani Rial ($69,233,125) New Shareholder Deferred Cash Investment into LLC promptly after\nthe Financing Agreement Date occurs.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe Company is considering several\nfinancing methods which would trigger the Financing Agreement Date and thereby also trigger the obligation of the New Shareholders\nto invest the 26,628,125 Omani Rial ($69,233,125) New Shareholder Deferred Cash Investment into LLC. Financing structures under\nconsideration to facilitate the execution of the maximum scope of Pre-Design Phase Activities include, but are not limited to,\nthe sale to non-U.S. investors of (i) unsecured mandatory-convertible LLC promissory notes and/or (ii) shares of LLC presently\nowned by Omagine followed by a loan from Omagine to LLC. The Company does not have any definitive agreements with respect to the\naforementioned financing methods and there cannot be any assurance that the Company will be able to obtain any financing. (See:\n\xe2\x80\x9cBusiness - Financing / Pre-Design Phase Activities / The Financing Agreement Date\xe2\x80\x9d above).\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe PIK investment by RCA into LLC will\nbe perfected concurrent with the Registration of the Usufruct Agreement at the Ministry of Housing. The valuation of the PIK has\nbeen determined by one of two specialist real-estate valuation companies engaged by LLC in accordance with the requirements of\nthe RICS. The capital of LLC will likely be increased further when the non-cash valuation of the PIK is recorded as a capital investment\ninto LLC.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe continuation of LLC\xe2\x80\x99s business\nto date has to a large extent been financed by Omagine. The DA has been signed and LLC will now have to arrange a significant\namount of Construction Financing in order to execute its plan to design and develop the Omagine Project (See: \xe2\x80\x9cBusiness\n- Financial Advisor\xe2\x80\x9d). The Company is relying for revenue growth upon the future business of LLC.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n    26\n    \xc2\xa0\n    \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOmagine Inc.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe continuation of Omagine\xe2\x80\x99s\noperations is dependent upon Omagine\xe2\x80\x99s ability to secure financing for its and LLC\xe2\x80\x99s operations until such time as\nthe Financing Agreement Date occurs and LLC begins paying Omagine the $10 million Success Fee and the approximately $9 million\n(as of April 2011) of Pre-Development Expenses. (See: \xe2\x80\x9cPre-Development Expenses / Success Fee\xe2\x80\x9d above).\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nIn order to generate the cash needed\nto sustain the Company\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing operations, Omagine has over the past many years relied on the proceeds from the YA Loans\nand from sales of Common Shares made pursuant to the Prior SEDAs and the 2012 rights offering as well as from sales of restricted\nCommon Shares made pursuant to private placements. Management is hopeful that the Warrants will provide a future source of additional\nfinancing.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nSubject to the necessary financial\nresources being available to it, Omagine intends to make a secured loan to LLC in order to finance the Pre-Design Phase Activities\nand trigger the Financing Agreement Date, thereby also triggering the investment into LLC by the New Shareholders of the 26,628,125\nOmani Rials ($69,233,125) New Shareholder Deferred Cash Investment.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nInvestors and shareholders should be\naware that we have had no revenue for the past several years and we do not expect to generate any revenue until after the development\nof the Omagine Project is well underway. The failure to ultimately secure project financing via the closing of a Syndicated Financing\nAgreement will have a materially significant negative effect on the Company\xe2\x80\x99s ability to continue operations.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nRights Offering and Warrant\nDistribution\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\nOmagine conducted a \xe2\x80\x9cRights Offering\nand Warrant Distribution\xe2\x80\x9d in 2012 for the sole benefit of its shareholders at the time (the \xe2\x80\x9cRecord Shareholders\xe2\x80\x9d)\npursuant to which Omagine distributed \xe2\x80\x9cRights\xe2\x80\x9d and Strategic Warrants to the Record Shareholders. The Rights, the Strategic\nWarrants and the Common Shares underlying the Rights and Strategic Warrants were registered in a registration statement filed by\nOmagine on Form S-1 (Commission File No. 333-179040), which was declared effective by the SEC on February 13, 2012 and in a separate\nregistration statement filed by Omagine on Form S-1 (Commission File No. 333-183852), which was declared effective by the SEC on\nApril 25, 2013 (the \xe2\x80\x9cWarrant Registration\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nA total of 1,014,032 Common Shares were\nsubscribed for in the Rights Offering at a subscription price of $1.25 per Common Share. Total proceeds to Omagine from the Rights\nOffering was $1,267,540 of which $731,639 was paid in cash and $535,901 was paid via the satisfaction of debt owed by Omagine to\nRecord Shareholders exercising such Rights. Of the 1,014,032 Common Shares issued pursuant to the Rights Offering, 585,311 were\nissued in exchange for $731,639 in cash and 428,721 were issued in satisfaction of $535,901 of debt constituting promissory notes\nfor loans to Omagine and accrued but unpaid salaries and expenses. Of the $535,901 of debt which was satisfied in the Rights Offering,\n$506,750 represented unpaid salaries, expenses and loans which were due and owing by Omagine to Omagine officers and directors.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOf the 6,422,124 Strategic Warrants\ndistributed, 3,211,062 are exercisable at $5 per Common Share and 3,211,062 are exercisable at $10 per Common Share. On August\n13, 2013, Omagine filed a Post-Effective Amendment on Form S-1 to the Warrant Registration (Commission File No. 333-183852) to\nupdate the Warrant Registration to include all 6,422,124 then issued and outstanding Strategic Warrants and the 6,422,124 Common\nShares underlying such Strategic Warrants (the \xe2\x80\x9cUpdated Warrant Registration\xe2\x80\x9d). The SEC declared the Updated Warrant\nRegistration to be effective as of August 26, 2013 which effective status had expired. Post-Effective Amendments No. 2 and No.\n3 to the Warrant Registration were filed with the SEC on January 28, 2015 and February 11, 2015, respectively, in order to further\nupdate the Warrant Registration and to re-instate its effective status. The SEC declared the Warrant Registration effective February\n13, 2015. All Strategic Warrants expire on December 31, 2015 unless redeemed earlier by Omagine.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nTempest Warrants\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nAs of April 6, 2015 there are 510,000\nTempest Warrants issued and outstanding.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOn June 24, 2014, Omagine issued the\n1,000,000 Tempest Warrants to an investor, each of which are exercisable for the purchase of one restricted Common Share at a per\nCommon Share exercise price equal to the greater of: (a) $1.00 per Common Share, or (b) 80% of the closing sale price for a Common\nShare on the Trading Day immediately preceding the relevant exercise date. On August 15, 2014, such investor transferred 240,000\nTempest Warrants to an affiliate and such affiliate exercised 240,000 Tempest Warrants on August 15, 2014 at $1.40 per share for\nthe purchase of 240,000 restricted Common Shares. On October 2, 2014, such investor transferred an additional 250,000 Tempest Warrants\nto such affiliate and such affiliate exercised 250,000 Tempest Warrants on October 2, 2014 at $1.31 per share for the purchase\nof 250,000 restricted Common Shares.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nBoth the Tempest Warrants and the Common\nShares issuable upon exercise of the Tempest Warrants are \xe2\x80\x9crestricted securities\xe2\x80\x9d as that term is defined in the Securities\nLaw. Omagine has no obligation nor present intention to register with the SEC either the Tempest Warrants or the Common Shares\nunderlying the Tempest Warrants.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe Tempest Warrants are subject to\nadjustment in the event of a stock split, combination or subdivision of the Common Stock or a dividend, reclassification, reorganization,\nor spin off. The Tempest Warrants may be exercised in whole or in part but only for whole shares of restricted Common Stock and\nthe Tempest Warrants are not redeemable by Omagine. The Tempest Warrants are exercisable at the option of the Tempest Warrant\nHolder at any time up until their expiration at 5 p.m. Eastern Time in the United States on June 23, 2016.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nStandby Equity Distribution\nAgreements\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nBetween 2009 and 2011, Omagine had a\nStand-By Equity Distribution Agreement with an affiliate of YA (the \xe2\x80\x9c2009 SEDA\xe2\x80\x9d). Omagine and YA were parties to a\nsecond Stand-By Equity Distribution Agreement (the \xe2\x80\x9c2011 SEDA\xe2\x80\x9d) which was terminated on July 21, 2014. The 2009 SEDA\nand the 2011 SEDA are collectively referred to herein as the \xe2\x80\x9cPrior SEDAs\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOn April 22, 2014, Omagine and YA entered\ninto a new Standby Equity Distribution Agreement which was amended on October 10, 2014 (the \xe2\x80\x9c2014 SEDA\xe2\x80\x9d). The 2014\nSEDA is generally on the same terms as the 2011 SEDA.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n    27\n    \xc2\xa0\n    \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nSince the DA is now signed, any use\nby Omagine of the 2014 SEDA will be guided by several factors, including but not limited to: (i) the availability and cost of alternative\nfinancing, (ii) our ability to rapidly access required financing, (iii) the liquidity and market price of our Common Stock, (iv)\nthe exercise, if any, of Warrants, (v) the likelihood (or actuality) of the success of our present efforts to arrange (a) new equity\ninvestments into Omagine and (b) new debt and/or equity investments into LLC, (vi) the likelihood (or actuality) of LLC having\nthe financial capacity to pay Omagine the $10 million Success Fee and the Pre-Development Expense Amount in excess of $9 million.\n(See: \xe2\x80\x9cRights Offering and Warrant Distribution, and Financial Advisor, and Business - The Shareholder Agreement / LLC Capital\nStructure - Pre-Development Expenses / Success Fee\xe2\x80\x9d, above), and (vii) our then current cash requirements.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nBecause the market for our Common Stock\nhas historically exhibited low liquidity levels, we may not be able to take full advantage of the 2014 SEDA if such liquidity levels\ndo not improve as a result of the recent DA signing. If the market for our Common Shares is exhibiting low liquidity levels at\nthe time we give YA an Advance Notice (a \xe2\x80\x9cPut\xe2\x80\x9d) and if YA sells Common Shares into the public market during the five\nTrading Day Pricing Period subsequent to our Put (as is YA\xe2\x80\x99s customary practice), it is likely that the price of our Common\nShares will decline. Any such price decline will immediately increase the number of Common Shares we would otherwise be required\nabsent such price decline to deliver to YA subsequent to the Pricing Period in satisfaction of such Put. If this pattern continued\nto happen with subsequent Puts by us, it is likely that we would issue and sell to YA the maximum 3,000,000 shares available under\nthe 2014 SEDA before reaching the aggregate sales price of $5 million available under the 2014 SEDA.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nLLC is now obligated to design, develop\nand construct the $2.5 billion Omagine Project. Given the size and scope of the Omagine Project, it is expected that LLC will require\na minimum of $300 million (possibly up to $500 million) of debt financing - the Construction Financing - over various times during\nthe next 4 to 5 years. This Construction Financing requirement will not be addressed by utilizing the 2014 SEDA (See: \xe2\x80\x9cFinancial\nAdvisor\xe2\x80\x9d, above). Notwithstanding that fact, the Company expects to have substantial and rapidly forthcoming working capital\nrequirements other than the Construction Financing.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nGiven the considerable resources we\nwill be required to bring to bear to execute the Omagine Project, we presently expect that we will fully utilize the entire $5\nmillion amount available to us under the 2014 SEDA. Such post-DA use of the 2014 SEDA will of course be guided by the price, liquidity\nand volatility of our Common Stock as we move forward. We cannot presently predict what other future sources of financing might\nbecome available to us to cause us to utilize less than the full $5 million available under the 2014 SEDA and our present assessment\nis that, we will surely need and will ultimately receive the full $5 million available under the 2014 SEDA. The Prior SEDAs indisputably\nprovided the Company the lifeline needed to achieve the DA signing and the 2014 SEDA will likely provide some of the supplementary\nworking capital the Company will need going forward.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nPrior SEDAs\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe 2009 SEDA expired in 2011. The 2011\nSEDA was due to expire on September 1, 2014 but was terminated on July 21, 2014 by the mutual consent of the parties (See: Exhibit\n10.11).\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nIn connection with the 2011 SEDA, Omagine\nfiled with the SEC a registration statement (the \xe2\x80\x9c2011 SEDA Registration Statement\xe2\x80\x9d) on Form S-1 (Commission File No.\n333-175168) pursuant to which 3,244,216 Common Shares were registered (including 244,216 Common Shares issued to YA in May and\nJune 2011 in satisfaction of the $300,000 commitment fees due under the 2011 SEDA). Between August 24, 2011 and May 6, 2014, YA\npurchased 561,690 Common Shares from Omagine under\xc2\xa0the 2011 SEDA for an aggregate Purchase Price of $835,000 and YA did not\nthereafter purchase any Common Shares from Omagine under\xc2\xa0the 2011 SEDA. On July 21, 2014 Omagine filed a post-effective amendment\nto the 2011 SEDA Registration Statement de-registering the previously registered 2,438,310 Common Shares which were not issued\nor sold to YA pursuant to the 2011 SEDA. Such post-effective amendment to the 2011 SEDA Registration Statement was declared effective\nby the SEC on July 25, 2014.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe 2014 SEDA\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOn April 22, 2014, Omagine and YA entered\ninto a new Standby Equity Distribution Agreement which was amended on October 10, 2014 (the \xe2\x80\x9c2014 SEDA\xe2\x80\x9d). The 2014\nSEDA is generally on the same terms as the 2011 SEDA. Unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, the 2014 SEDA shall\nautomatically expire on the earlier of (i) the first day of the month next following the 24-month anniversary of the \xe2\x80\x9cRegistration\nEffective Date\xe2\x80\x9d (as hereinafter defined), or (ii) the date on which YA shall have made payment of Advances pursuant to the\n2014 SEDA in the aggregate amount of $5,000,000. In satisfaction of a $150,000 commitment fee due pursuant to the 2014 SEDA, Omagine\nissued 85,822 restricted Common Shares to YA Global II SPV, LLC which is an affiliate of YA.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nPursuant to the terms of the 2014 SEDA,\nOmagine may in its sole discretion, and upon giving written notice to YA (an \xe2\x80\x9cAdvance Notice\xe2\x80\x9d), periodically sell Common\nShares to YA (\xe2\x80\x9cShares\xe2\x80\x9d) at a per Share price (\xe2\x80\x9cPurchase Price\xe2\x80\x9d) equal to 95% of the lowest daily volume\nweighted average price (the \xe2\x80\x9cVWAP\xe2\x80\x9d) for a Common Share as quoted by Bloomberg, L.P. during the five (5) consecutive\nTrading Days (as such term is defined in the 2014 SEDA) immediately subsequent to the date of the relevant Advance Notice (the\n\xe2\x80\x9cPricing Period\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOmagine is not obligated to sell any\nShares to YA but may, over the term of the 2014 SEDA and in its sole discretion, sell to YA that number of Shares valued at the\nPurchase Price from time to time in effect that equals up to five million dollars ($5,000,000) in the aggregate. YA is obligated\nunder the 2014 SEDA to purchase such Shares from Omagine subject to certain conditions including (i) Omagine filing a registration\nstatement with the SEC to register the resale by YA of the Shares sold to YA under the 2014 SEDA (\xe2\x80\x9cRegistration Statement\xe2\x80\x9d),\n(ii) the SEC declaring such Registration Statement effective (the date of such declaration by the SEC being the \xe2\x80\x9cRegistration\nEffective Date\xe2\x80\x9d), (iii) Omagine certifying to YA at the time of each Advance Notice that Omagine has performed all covenants\nand agreements to be performed and has complied with all obligations and conditions contained in the 2014 SEDA, (iv) periodic sales\nof Shares to YA must be separated by a time period of at least five Trading Days, and (v) the dollar value of any individual periodic\nsale of Shares designated by Omagine in any Advance Notice may not exceed the greater of (a) two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000),\nor (b) the average of the "Daily Value Traded" for each of the five (5) Trading Days immediately preceding the date of\nthe relevant Advance Notice where Daily Value Traded is the product obtained by multiplying the number representing the daily trading\nvolume of Common Shares for such Trading Day by the VWAP for Common Share on such Trading Day.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n    28\n    \xc2\xa0\n    \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nPursuant to the 2014 SEDA in no event\nshall the number of Common Shares issuable to YA pursuant to an Advance cause the aggregate number of Common Shares beneficially\nowned (as calculated pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), by YA and its affiliates to\nexceed 9.99% of the then outstanding common stock of the Company. In addition this 9.99% ownership cap may not be waived by YA\nor Omagine and since such ownership cap includes all Common Shares owned by any YA affiliate, such cap cannot be avoided by transferring\nCommon Shares to an affiliate of YA.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nIn connection with the 2014 SEDA, on\nOctober 15, 2014 Omagine filed the Registration Statement on Form S-1 to register the 3,085,822 Common Shares covered by the 2014\nSEDA. On January 8, 2015, Omagine filed an amendment to that Registration Statement and such amendment to the 2014 SEDA Registration\nStatement was declared effective by the SEC on January 22, 2015.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe foregoing summaries of the terms\nof the Prior SEDAs and of the 2014 SEDA do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full\ntexts of the Prior SEDAs and the 2014 SEDA, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.6, 10.7, and 10.10.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nSales of Common Shares to YA pursuant\nto the Prior SEDAs totaled 561,690 Common Shares for an aggregate Purchase Price of $835,000. Management believes that it has\nbeen judicious and conservative in its use to date of the Prior SEDAs, but nonetheless our periodic sales of Common Shares to\nYA or its affiliate pursuant to the Prior SEDAs have been dilutive to all shareholders and the subsequent resales by YA of such\nCommon Shares into the public market have from time to time inflicted downward pressure on our stock price. Omagine intends to\nutilize the 2014 SEDA to fund its ongoing operations as and if necessary.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe YA Loan Agreements\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOmagine and YA, the investment fund\nwhich is a party with Omagine to the 2014 SEDA, entered into an unsecured loan agreement dated July 26, 2013 (the \xe2\x80\x9c2013 YA\nLoan Agreement\xe2\x80\x9d). Pursuant to the 2013 YA Loan Agreement, Omagine borrowed two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) from YA\n(the \xe2\x80\x9c2013 YA Loan\xe2\x80\x9d) for a term of one year at an annual interest rate of 10%. The 2013 YA Loan Agreement called for\na 10% monitoring and management fee equal to $20,000 to be escrowed and paid to Yorkville Advisors thereby making the net proceeds\nfrom the 2013 YA Loan to Omagine equal to $180,000. Such $180,000 of proceeds was received by Omagine on September 3, 2013. The\n2013 YA Loan Agreement also extended the expiration date of the 2011 SEDA. The foregoing summary of the terms of the 2013 YA Loan\ndoes not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2013 YA Loan Agreement attached\nhereto as Exhibit 10.12.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOn April 22, 2014, Omagine and YA entered\ninto another unsecured loan agreement (the \xe2\x80\x9c2014 YA Loan Agreement\xe2\x80\x9d) whereby Omagine borrowed five hundred thousand\ndollars ($500,000) from YA (the \xe2\x80\x9c2014 YA Loan\xe2\x80\x9d) for a term of one year at an annual interest rate of 10%. Pursuant\nto the 2014 YA Loan Agreement, on April 22, 2014, through deduction from the $500,000 principal balance of the 2014 YA Loan, Omagine\n(i) paid the $110,680 balance then due under the 2013 YA Loan Agreement, (ii) paid a $39,000 commitment fee with respect to the\n2014 YA Loan, and (iii) prepaid the $1,096 of interest due on the 2014 YA Loan for the period April 23, 2014 through April 30,\n2014. The $349,224 net proceeds of the 2014 YA Loan was received by Omagine on April 23, 2014. The foregoing summary of the terms\nof the 2014 YA Loan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the YA Note\nPurchase Agreement, the YA Note and the YA Closing Statement attached hereto as Exhibits 10.13; 10.14; and 10.15 respectively.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOmagine presently anticipates that the\n2014 YA Loan will be repaid from proceeds of sales of Common Shares made pursuant to (a) private placement transactions, (b) the\nexercise of Warrants, or (c) the 2014 SEDA, or a combination thereof.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThere can be no assurance given that\nOmagine will be able to successfully utilize the Warrants or the 2014 SEDA to secure the significant amount of financing necessary\nfor it to execute its business plan as presently conceived.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nCapital Expenditures and Construction\nFinancing\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\nThe Company incurred $3,434 for capital\nexpenditures in fiscal year 2014. Since the DA is now signed, we expect that (i) the Company will incur significant expenses related\nto capital expenditures, and (ii) LLC will incur substantial debt associated with the Construction Financing for the Omagine Project.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWe presently expect that such capital\nexpenditures will be largely concentrated at LLC and will largely comprise the purchase by LLC and Omagine of the quantities of\noffice equipment, furniture, vehicles, computer hardware and software and telecommunications equipment which will be necessary\nto service the expanded staff and offices required at both LLC and Omagine to manage the ramping up of our business operations\nin Oman and the U.S. now that the DA has been signed.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWe presently expect that such capital\nexpenditures will be financed:\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n    i.\n    at Omagine via the proceeds from sales of Common Shares via the 2014 SEDA, the exercise of Warrants, private placement sales of restricted Common Shares, possible private placement sales of LLC Shares and the payments received from LLC with respect to the Success Fee and the Pre-Development Expense Amount, and\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n    ii.\n    at LLC through a combination of invested capital, Pre-Design Phase Financing, syndicated bank financing, loans\nfrom Omagine and the sale or sales of additional LLC equity or debt instruments (See: \xe2\x80\x9cBusiness - The Shareholder Agreement\n/ LLC Capital Structure\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cFinancing/Pre-Design Phase Activities / The Financing Agreement Date\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n    29\n    \xc2\xa0\n    \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nNo assurance can be given that such\nfinancing will be available to the Company at either Omagine or LLC.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWe presently expect that LLC\'s Construction\nFinancing requirements will be financed via Syndicated Financing Agreements with several regional and international banks as arranged\nby LLC and its Financial Adviser. LLC\xe2\x80\x99s requirement for Construction Financing is expected to be reduced by its ability\nto pre-sell residence and commercial units by entering into sales contracts with third party purchasers and receiving deposits\nand progress payments during the construction of such units. Recent trends in the Omani market subsequent to the recent worldwide\nfinancial crisis however have indicated a reduced consumer appetite for pre-sales of residence units as many more buyers are now\ndemanding a finished product before entering into sales contracts with developers. . (See: \xe2\x80\x9cBusiness - Financial Advisor\xe2\x80\x9d\nand \xe2\x80\x9cMarket Conditions\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSales & Marketing\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWe have not entered into and have no\npresent intention of entering into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements. We have not formed and have no present intention\nof forming any special purpose entities.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nImpact of Inflation\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nThe level of inflation in the U.S.\nhas been relatively low during the last several fiscal years and has not had a significant impact on Omagine. Although inflation\nin Oman has also been relatively low during the last several fiscal years, the Oman economy has recently been experiencing volatility\nin its inflation rate (including in the prices of construction materials and labor) which volatility may have an impact on LLC\'s\nproposed future operations in Oman.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nItem 7A.

The amount of the valuation allowance that we recorded represents the deferred taxes for which we determined it is not more-likely-than-not that we will realize the benefits in future periods. We will continue to evaluate the valuation allowance and if actual outcomes differ from our current expectations, we may record additional valuation allowance or reverse the allowance, in whole or in part, through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Despite having this valuation allowance, for the 2017 tax year, we anticipate being a U.S. taxpayer and benefiting from our deferred taxes as they become realized in our federal tax return.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t20\n\n\t\t\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\tTable of Contents\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCareerBuilder Transaction and Impairment Charge\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAs discussed further in Note 2, in July 2017, we - along with the then existing ownership group of CareerBuilder - sold a majority of the collective ownership interest in CareerBuilder.

As a result of the closing of the transaction, our ownership interest in CareerBuilder was reduced to approximately 3.0% from 15.0%.

compared to 2016 primarily due to the continued decline in demand for print advertising. Consistent with the end of 2016, the decline in print advertising was primarily a result of large retail advertisers continuing to reduce preprinted insert and in-newspaper ROP\xc2\xa0advertising. The decline in print advertising revenues is the result of the desire of advertisers to reach customers directly through online advertising, and the secular shift in advertising demand from print to digital products. We expect these trends to continue for the foreseeable future. The decrease in total revenues was partially offset by the 53rd week in 2017 that we estimate provide for an additional $6.6 million in advertising revenues, $6.7 million in audience revenues and $14.0 million in total revenues.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t22\n\n\t\t\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\tTable of Contents\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAdvertising Revenues\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTotal advertising revenues decreased 12.3% during 2017 compared to 2016. While we experienced declines in all of our advertising revenue categories, the decrease in total advertising revenues was primarily related to declines in print retail and print and digital classified advertising revenues.

In 2017, the decrease in retail advertising revenues was primarily due to decreases of 22.9% in print ROP advertising revenues and 25.5% in preprint advertising revenues, compared to 2016. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in digital retail advertising of 2.0% in 2017 compared to 2016.

During 2017, we experienced decreases of 13.1% and 11.1% in print classified advertising and digital classified advertising, respectively, compared to 2016, which were led by automotive and employment advertising. Our decrease in print classified advertising revenues resulted from the continued shift of print advertising to digital platforms, while the decrease in digital classified advertising was primarily due to the large number of competitors in the digital environment. Accordingly, we expect this market will continue to be volatile and highly competitive. The real estate category had similar results, although to a lesser extent, due to similar trends. Other classified advertising revenues, which is our largest classified category and includes legal, remembrance and celebration notices and miscellaneous advertising, also experienced decreases in both print and digital in 2017 compared to 2016.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDigital Advertising:\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDigital advertising revenues, which are included in each of the advertising categories discussed above, constituted 34.7% of total advertising revenues during 2017 compared to 30.6% during 2016. Total digital advertising includes digital advertising bundled with print and digital-only advertising. Digital-only advertising is defined as digital advertising sold on a stand-alone basis or as the primary advertising buy with print sold as an \xe2\x80\x9cup-sell.\xe2\x80\x9d Digital-only advertising revenues increased 9.8% to $133.7 million in 2017 compared to 2016. In 2017, total digital advertising revenues decreased 0.6% to $173.1 million compared to 2016 reflecting the negative impact of lower print advertising revenues on bundled sales. Digital advertising revenues bundled with print products declined 24.8% in 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of fewer print advertising sales. The advertising industry continues to experience a secular shift in advertising demand from print to digital products as advertisers look for multiple advertising channels to reach their customers and are increasingly focused on online customers. While our product offerings and collaboration efforts in digital advertising have grown, we expect to continue to face intense competition in the digital advertising space.\xc2\xa0 \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDirect Marketing and Other:\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDirect marketing and other advertising revenues decreased 5.5% during 2017 compared to 2016. This represents a lower rate of decline from trends in 2016 when these revenues decreased by 9.5% compared to 2015. The lower rate of decline in 2017 versus in 2016 was partially due to the addition of new customers in certain markets in the second half of 2016, which was largely offset by the declines in preprint retail advertising by large retail customers as described above.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAudience Revenues\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAudience revenues decreased slightly at 0.4% during 2017 compared to 2016. Overall, digital audience revenues increased 0.9% during 2017 and digital-only audience revenues associated with digital subscriptions increased 9.8% in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in digital-only audience revenues during 2017 was a result of (i) a \xc2\xa023.8% increase in our digital-only subscribers to 102,900 as of the end of 2017 compared to 2016, (ii) digital subscription rate increases in some markets, and (iii) the revenues received in the 53rd week of 2017. Print audience revenues decreased 0.8% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to pricing adjustments that were implemented and were partially offset by lower print circulation volumes and the 53rd week of 2017. We have a dynamic pricing model for our traditional print subscriptions for which pricing is constantly being adjusted based upon the market\xe2\x80\x99s ability to accept pricing adjustments. Print circulation volumes continue to decline as a result of fragmentation of audiences faced by all media as available media outlets proliferate and readership trends change. To help reduce potential attrition due to the increased pricing, we also increased our subscription related marketing and promotion efforts.\xc2\xa0 \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOperating Expenses\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTotal operating expenses decreased 8.3% in 2017, compared to 2016. Retirement benefit expenses related to the pension and post-retirement benefits are now recorded as non-operating costs (see Note 1) and therefore, excluded from this discussion in all periods presented. The decreases during 2017 were primarily due to decreases in compensation and other operating expenses compared to 2016, as discussed below. Our total operating expenses reflect our continued effort to reduce costs through streamlining processes to gain efficiencies. These decreases in total operating expenses were partially offset by an increase in impairment charges recorded during 2017, as discussed below. As discussed above, our operating expenses for 2017 also include a 53rd week, which results in higher expenses during the period than the comparable period in 2016.

expenses, which included both payroll and fringe benefit costs, decreased 8.2% in 2017 compared to 2016. Payroll expenses declined 7.5% during 2017 compared to 2016, reflecting a 13.3% decline in average full-time equivalent employees. Similarly, fringe benefits costs decreased 12.3% in 2017 compared to 2016. These decreases were primarily due to decreases in health benefit costs and other fringe benefit costs, a result of lower headcount. \xc2\xa0The decrease in fringe benefit costs is also impacted by the $2.3 million charge we incurred during 2016 when we outsourced the printing production at one of our media companies and exited the multiemployer pension plans that covered the impacted employees that was not repeated in 2017. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNewsprint, supplements and printing expenses decreased 15.8% in 2017 compared to 2016. Newsprint expense declined 20.1% during 2017 compared to 2016. The decline in newsprint expense reflects a decrease in newsprint usage of 21.1% in 2017, partially offset by an increase in newsprint prices of 1.3%, in both cases compared to 2016. During this same period, printing expenses, which are primarily outsourced printing costs, decreased $3.0 million or 9.3%.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDepreciation and amortization expenses decreased 10.4% in 2017 compared to 2016. Depreciation expense decreased $10.6 million in 2017 compared to 2016, as a result of assets becoming fully depreciated in previous periods and due to $7.0 million in accelerated depreciation charges taken in 2016 compared to only $0.3 million in 2017.\xc2\xa0The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by the 53rd week in 2017. Amortization expense increased $1.3 million in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the intangible assets acquired in December 2016 when we purchased The (Durham, NC) Herald-Sun and due to the 53rd week in 2017. \xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOther operating expenses decreased 10.2% in 2017 compared to 2016. In 2017, other operating expenses included $23.6 million gain on the disposal of property and equipment compared to $5.8 million in 2016. In addition, as a result of our efforts to reduce operational costs, we had decreases of $8.8 million in circulation delivery costs, $2.6 million in production costs, and $10.5 million in relocation and other costs, which were partially offset by an increase of $4.9 million in professional fees, \xc2\xa0$1.3 million in other miscellaneous expenses and the 53rd week in 2017.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOther asset write-downs include an impairment charge of $21.5 million related to intangible newspaper mastheads during 2017, and a write down of $2.0 million of non-newsprint inventory during 2017. During 2016, other asset write-downs include $9.2 million write-downs of intangible newspaper mastheads and\xc2\xa0$0.3 million related to certain assets held for sale.

Interest expense related to debt balances decreased by $4.8 million in 2017 as a result of lower overall debt balances reflecting repurchases of debt made during 2016 and in 2017. In 2017, this was offset by a $2.0 million increase of non-cash imputed interest related to our financing obligations that increased due to our contribution of real properties to our Pension Plan and due to the sale and leaseback of our Sacramento property.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEquity Income (Loss) in Unconsolidated Companies, Net:\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDuring 2017, we recorded equity losses in unconsolidated companies of $1.7 million as compared to income of $13.4 million in 2016.

During 2016, we recorded a $0.9 million write-down related to our equity investment in HomeFinder, LLC (\xe2\x80\x9cHomeFinder\xe2\x80\x9d), which was sold in the first quarter of 2016.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tExtinguishment of Debt:\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDuring 2017, we retired, repurchased or redeemed $68.7 million aggregate principal amount of various series of our outstanding notes. We repurchased some of these notes at a price higher than par value and redeemed some at par value.

As discussed more fully in Note 1(under Income Taxes) and Note 5, during 2017, we recorded a $192.3 million valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets because we determined that it is not more-likely-than-not that we will realize such deferred tax assets. The remaining income tax benefit differed from the expected federal tax amounts primarily due to the inclusion of state income taxes, the tax impact of stock compensation, the benefit from the reduced federal tax rate as a result of the Tax Act on our deferred tax liabilities, and certain permanently non-deductible expenses.\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIn 2016, we recorded an income tax benefit of $13.1 million. The income tax benefit differs from the expected federal tax amounts primarily due to the inclusion of state income taxes, non-deductible stock related compensation, certain discrete tax items and the

These decreases were partially offset by increases in digital retail advertising of 8.5% in 2016 compared to 2015 as advertisers continued to move to digital.

Overall, the decrease in total national advertising revenues during 2016 was led by the telecommunications category. The increase in digital national advertising revenues during 2016 was largely led by programmatic digital advertising, including mobile, political and video revenues.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tClassified:\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIn 2016, classified advertising revenues decreased 10.6% compared to 2015.

Our decrease in print classified advertising revenues resulted from the continued shift of print advertising to digital platforms, while the decrease in digital classified advertising was primarily due to the large number of competitors in digital environment. The real estate category had similar results in print classified advertising, although to a lesser extent due to similar trends. The real estate category increased slightly in the digital classified advertising. Other classified advertising revenues, which is our largest classified category and includes legal, remembrance and celebration notices and miscellaneous advertising, also experienced decreases in both print and digital in 2016 compared to 2015 and we believe these trends will continue in the near term.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t27\n\n\t\t\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\tTable of Contents\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDigital Advertising:\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDigital advertising revenues, which were included in each of the advertising categories discussed above, constituted 30.6% of total advertising revenues in 2016 compared to 26.2% in 2015.

Digital advertising revenues bundled with print products declined 14.0% in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of fewer print advertising sales. The advertising industry was still experiencing a secular shift in advertising demand from print to digital products as advertisers looked for multiple advertising channels to reach their customers. While our product offerings and collaboration efforts in digital advertising had grown, we expected and continue to expect to face intense competition in the digital advertising space.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDirect Marketing and Other:\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDirect marketing and other advertising revenues decreased 9.5% during 2016 compared to 2015.

Print audience revenues declined 1.8% in 2016 compared to 2015. We used a dynamic pricing model for our traditional subscriptions for which pricing was constantly being adjusted based upon a variety of market factors. This dynamic pricing model helped to partially offset print circulation declines. Print circulation volumes continued to decline as a result of fragmentation of audiences faced by all media as available media outlets proliferate and readership trends change. To help reduce potential attrition due to the increased pricing, we also increased our subscription-related marketing and promotion efforts.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOperating Expenses\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTotal operating expenses decreased 27.3% in 2016 compared to 2015. Retirement benefit expenses related to the pension and post-retirement benefits are now recorded as non-operating costs (see Note 1) and therefore excluded from this discussion in all periods presented. The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower impairment charges incurred during 2016 compared to 2015. The decreases in 2016 were also due in part to our continued effort to reduce costs.

Fringe benefit costs decreased 1.7% in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower\xc2\xa0health care costs, partially offset by a $2.3 million charge incurred when we outsourced the printing production at one of our media companies and exited the multiemployer pension plans that covered the impacted employees.\xc2\xa0 \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNewsprint, supplements and printing expenses decreased 17.5% in 2016 compared to 2015.

Depreciation expense decreased $11.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015, partially due to the impact and timing of accelerated depreciation during the periods and due to assets that became fully depreciated in 2015 or early 2016. During 2016, we incurred accelerated depreciation of $7.0 million compared to $10.3 million in accelerated depreciation during\xc2\xa02015. The accelerated depreciation during 2016 and 2015 related to production equipment associated with outsourcing our printing process at certain of our media companies.

In 2016, other operating expenses included decreases in circulation delivery costs of $12.8 million as expected due to decreased circulation volumes, professional fees of $2.1 million, postage of $2.8 million, as well as other miscellaneous expenses of $11.0 million, which were partially offset by increases in sales costs for digital advertising of $5.4 million and $12.0 million in relocation and other costs, which we believed\xc2\xa0would result in significant future cost savings. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIn 2016, goodwill impairment and other asset write-downs included $9.2 million in non-cash impairment charges related to intangible newspaper mastheads and $0.3 million related to classifying certain assets as assets held for sale during 2016.

Interest expense on debt declined by $7.4 million, or 8.7% in 2016 compared to 2015. The lower interest expense on debt was partially offset by a $3.8 million increase of non-cash imputed interest related to our financing obligations that grew due to the contributed real properties to our Pension Plan in January 2016. \xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEquity Income in Unconsolidated Companies, Net:\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTotal income from unconsolidated investments increased 23.8% during 2016 compared to 2015. While we had lower income from our equity method investments in 2016 compared to 2015, the increase in income from unconsolidated investments was due to the timing of write-downs. During 2016 and 2015, we recorded write\xe2\x80\x91downs of $1.0 million and $8.2 million, respectively, which reduced our equity income in unconsolidated companies, net, in the consolidated statements of operations. The write-down in 2016 was related to our HomeFinder investment, which was sold in the first quarter of 2016. The write-down in 2015 was primarily related to CareerBuilder, LLC, which recorded a non-cash, goodwill impairment charge related to their international reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2015.

However, in January 2018 we used a significant portion of the cash on hand to redeem $75.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 9.00% Notes as announced in December 2017, and in February 2018 we repurchase an additional $20.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 9.00% Notes. Following the redemption of notes in January 2018 and repurchases in February 2018, we had approximately $710.0 million remaining in outstanding indebtedness. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWe expect that most of our cash and cash equivalents, and our cash generated from operations, for the foreseeable future will be used to repay debt, pay income taxes, fund our capital expenditures, invest in new revenue initiatives, digital investments and enterprise-wide operating systems, make required contributions to the Pension Plan, and for other corporate uses as determined by management and our Board of Directors. As discussed above and in Note 4, following the partial redemption in January 2018 and the repurchases in February 2018, we had approximately $710.0 million in total aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding, consisting of $344.6 million of our 9.00% Notes due 2022 and $365.4 million of our notes due in 2027 and 2029. We expect to continue to opportunistically repurchase or restructure our debt from time to time if market conditions are favorable, whether through privately negotiated repurchases of debt using cash from operations, or other types of tender offers or exchange offers or other means. We also expect that we will refinance or restructure a significant portion of this debt prior to the scheduled maturity of such debt. However, we may not be able to do so on terms favorable to us or at all. We may also be required to use cash on hand or cash from operations to meet these obligations. We believe that our cash from operations is sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs over the next 12 months, while maintaining adequate cash and cash equivalents to fund our

activities in\xc2\xa02017, compared to generating $75.4 million of cash in 2016. The change is partially due to the timing of income tax payments in 2017 compared to 2016. In 2017, we had net income tax payments of $12.4 million compared to $2.5 million in 2016. In addition, the change in cash generated from operating activities was due to the timing of collections of accounts receivable, which were lower by $11.5 million. The remaining changes in operating activities related to miscellaneous timing differences in various receipts and payments.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWe generated $75.4 million of cash from operating activities in 2016 compared to using $122.5 million of cash from operating activities in 2015. The change is primarily due to the timing of income tax payments of $2.5 million in 2016 compared to $207.0 million in 2015. This difference was primarily related to the tax payments made in the first quarter of 2015 related to the gain on sale of a previously owned equity investment that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014, offset by the tax losses on bond repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2014.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPension Plan Matters\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWe made no cash contributions to the Pension Plan during 2017, 2016 or 2015. In February 2016, we contributed certain of our real property appraised at $47.1 million to our Pension Plan. The contribution of real property exceeded our required pension contribution for 2016. After applying credits, which resulted from contributing more than the Pension Plan\xe2\x80\x99s minimum required contribution amounts in prior years, we did not have a required cash contribution for 2017 and we do not expect to have a required pension contribution under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act in fiscal year 2018.

based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on \n\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t32\n\n\t\t\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\tTable of Contents\n\n\t\t\n\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. However, future events are subject to change and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment. The most significant areas involving estimates and assumptions are amortization and/or impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, pension and post\xe2\x80\x91retirement expenses, and our accounting for income taxes. We believe the following critical accounting policies, in particular, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGoodwill:\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGoodwill consists of the excess of cost of acquired enterprises over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed. We assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at a reporting unit level, and we have identified two reporting units. \xc2\xa0One reporting unit (\xe2\x80\x9cWest\xe2\x80\x9d reporting unit) consists of operations in our West and Midwest regions and the other reporting unit (\xe2\x80\x9cEast\xe2\x80\x9d reporting unit) consists of operations primarily in our Carolinas and\xc2\xa0East regions. Goodwill is assessed between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, a change in strategic direction, legal factors, operating performance indicators, a change in the competitive environment, the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit, or future economic factors such as unfavorable changes in our stock price and market capitalization or unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flows of our reporting units. Our annual test is performed at our fiscal year end.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. We considered both a market approach and an income approach in order to develop an estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit for purposes of our annual impairment test. When available, and as appropriate, we use market multiples derived from a set of competitors or companies with comparable market characteristics to establish fair values for a particular reporting unit (market approach). We also estimate fair value using discounted projected cash flow analysis (income approach). Potential impairment is indicated when the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its estimated fair value. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long\xe2\x80\x91term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially\xc2\xa0affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. In addition, financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital, used to determine our discount rate, and through our stock price, used to determine our market capitalization. We may be required to recognize impairment of goodwill based on future economic factors such as unfavorable changes in our stock price and market capitalization or unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flows of our reporting units.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAn impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit\'s net assets exceed the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet becomes impaired during a future period, the resulting impairment charge could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDue to the economic environment in our industry and the uncertainties regarding potential future economic impacts on our reporting units, there can be no assurances that estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If assumptions regarding forecasted revenues or margins of certain of our reporting units are not achieved, we may be required to record goodwill impairment losses in future periods. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment loss would occur, and if it did occur, whether such charge would be material.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWe performed an interim goodwill impairment testing at June 28, 2015, based on the reporting units that existed at that time. Based on that testing, the fair value of our reporting unit that primarily consisted of operations in California, the Northwest and Texas, exceeded the carrying value and we did not incur any goodwill impairment for that reporting unit. The reporting unit that primarily consisted of operations in the Southeast, Florida and the Midwest, recorded an impairment charge of $290.9 million during the quarter and six months ended June 28, 2015, as described. No additional impairment was recorded during 2015 and no goodwill impairments were recorded in 2016 or 2017.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tBased on our annual impairment testing analysis, at December 31, 2017, the fair value of our West reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately 13.1%, and the fair value of the East reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately 33.5%. Assumptions, including projected revenues, are highly subjective and sensitive to industry and our performance.\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t33\n\n\t\t\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\tTable of Contents\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tMastheads:\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNewspaper mastheads (newspaper titles and website domain names) are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually, \xc2\xa0at year\xe2\x80\x91end, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of each newspaper masthead with its carrying amount. We use a relief-from-royalty approach that utilizes the discounted cash flow model discussed above, to determine the fair value of each newspaper masthead. Our judgments and estimates of future operating results in determining the reporting unit fair values are consistently applied to each newspaper in determining the fair value of each newspaper masthead.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWe performed our year-end masthead impairment tests in 2016, and interim and annual tests were performed in 2015 and 2017. As a result of our testing, we recorded total impairment charges of $21.5 million, $9.2 million and $13.9 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOther Intangible Assets:\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLong\xe2\x80\x91lived assets such as other intangible assets subject to amortization (primarily advertiser and subscriber lists) are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of each asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of such asset group. No impairment loss was recognized on intangible assets subject to amortization in 2017, 2016 or 2015.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPension and Post\xe2\x80\x91Retirement Benefits:\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWe have significant pension and post\xe2\x80\x91retirement benefit costs and credits that are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets. We are required to consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in establishing these assumptions. Changes in the related pension and post\xe2\x80\x91retirement benefit costs or credits may occur in the future because of changes resulting from fluctuations in our employee headcount and/or changes in the various assumptions.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCurrent standards of accounting for defined benefit pension plans and post\xe2\x80\x91retirement benefit plans require recognition of (1)\xc2\xa0the funded status of a pension plan (difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation) and (2)\xc2\xa0the funded status of a post\xe2\x80\x91retirement plan (difference between the plan assets at fair value and the accumulated benefit obligation), as an asset or liability on the balance sheet. At December 31, 2017 and December 25, 2016, \xc2\xa0we had a total pension and post-retirement obligation of $602.1 million and $606.5 million, respectively.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWe maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan (\xe2\x80\x9cPension Plan\xe2\x80\x9d), which covers certain eligible employees. Benefits are based on years of service that continue to count toward early retirement calculations and vesting previously earned. No new participants may enter the Pension Plan and no further benefits will accrue.\xc2\xa0For our\xc2\xa0Pension Plan, the\xc2\xa0net retirement obligations in excess of the retirement plan assets were\xc2\xa0$476.7 million and $487.4 million as of December 31, 2017, and December 25, 2016, respectively. We used \xc2\xa0a discount rate of 4.53% and an assumed long\xe2\x80\x91term return on assets of 7.75% to calculate our retirement plan expenses in 2017.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWe also have a limited number of supplemental and post-retirement plans to provide certain key employees and retirees with additional retirement benefits. These plans are funded on a pay\xe2\x80\x91as\xe2\x80\x91you\xe2\x80\x91go basis. \xc2\xa0For these\xc2\xa0non\xe2\x80\x91qualified plans that do not have assets, the post-retirement obligations\xc2\xa0were\xc2\xa0$125.4 million and $119.1 million as of December 31, 2017, and December 25, 2016, respectively. We used discount rates of 4.13% to 4.50% to calculate our retirement plan expenses in 2017. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFor 2017, for the Pension Plan and the non-qualified post-retirement plans combined, a change in the weighted average rates would have had the following impact on our net benefit cost:\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \xc2\xb7\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tA decrease of 50 basis points in the long\xe2\x80\x91term rate of return would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately $6.7\xc2\xa0million; and \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \xc2\xb7\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tA decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would not have a material effect on our net benefit cost.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t34\n\n\t\t\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\tTable of Contents\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIncome Taxes:\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOur current and deferred income tax provisions are calculated based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. These estimates are reviewed and adjusted, if needed, throughout the year. Adjustments between our estimates and the actual results of filed returns are recorded when identified.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe amount of income taxes paid is subject to periodic audits by federal and state taxing authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. These audits may challenge certain aspects of our tax positions such as the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of taxable income to the various tax jurisdictions. Income tax contingencies require significant judgment in estimating final outcomes. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future periods.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWe account for income taxes using the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAs of December 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Act; however, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances. We re-measured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. We are still analyzing certain aspects of the Tax Act, including the impact of the limitations on certain employee compensation, the deductibility of certain purchases of fixed assets, and the allowance of an indefinite carryforward period of net operating losses, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. The provisional amount recorded related to the re-measurement of our net deferred tax balance using the new federal tax rate was a benefit of $5.5 million. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe timing of recording or releasing a valuation allowance requires significant judgment. A valuation allowance is required when it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized. Establishment and removal of a valuation allowance requires us to consider all positive and negative evidence and to make a judgmental decision regarding the timing and amount of valuation allowance required as of a reporting date. The assessment takes into account expectations of future taxable income or loss, available tax planning strategies and the reversal of temporary differences. The development of these expectations involves the use of estimates such as operating profitability. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWe performed an assessment of the deferred tax assets during the third and fourth quarters of 2017, weighing the positive and negative evidence as outlined in ASC 740, Income Taxes. As we have incurred three years of cumulative pre-tax losses, such objective negative evidence limits our ability to give significant weight to other positive subjective evidence, such as projections for future growth and profitability. Accordingly, we recorded a valuation allowance charge of $192.3 million for 2017, which was recorded in income tax (benefit) expense on our consolidated statements of operations. During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, as a result of the Tax Act, principally the change to allow an indefinite carryforward period of net operating losses, we reassessed our analysis and decreased our related valuation allowance by $53.6 million. As of December 31, 2017, our valuation allowance against a majority of our net deferred tax assets was $109.7 million. As a result of these adjustments in 2017, our effective tax rate for 2017 is not comparable to the effective tax rate for 2016.\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWe will continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets until we believe it is more-likely-than-not that these assets will be realized in the future. If sufficient positive evidence, such as three-year cumulative pre-tax income, arises in the future that provides an indication that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets meet the more-likely-than-not standard, the valuation allowance may be reversed, in whole or in part, in the period that such determination is made.\xc2\xa0 \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFor information regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements, see Note\xc2\xa01.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t35\n\n\t\t\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\tTable of Contents\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tITEM 7A.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe primary objective of the following information is to provide forward\xe2\x80\x91looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term \xe2\x80\x9cmarket risk\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and credit risk. The disclosure is not meant to be a precise indicator of expected future losses but rather an indicator of reasonably possible losses. Our exposure to market risk primarily relates to discount rates used in our pension liabilities.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tInterest Rate Risks in Our Debt Obligations\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSubstantially all of our outstanding debt is composed of fixed\xe2\x80\x91rate bonds and, therefore, is not subject to interest rate fluctuations.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDiscount Rate Risks in Our Pension and Post\xe2\x80\x91Retirement Obligations\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe discount rate used to measure our obligations under our qualified defined benefit pension plan is generally based upon long\xe2\x80\x91term interest rates on highly\xe2\x80\x91rated corporate bonds. Hence, changes in long\xe2\x80\x91term interest rates may have a significant impact on the funding position of our qualified defined pension plan. We estimate that a 1.0% increase in our discount rate could decrease our pension obligations by approximately $218 million. Conversely, a 1.0% decrease in our discount rate could increase our pension obligations by approximately $264 million. Based on current interest rates, the amount of contributions due to the plan and the timing of the payments of these obligations are included in the table of contractual obligations above and reflect actuarial estimates we believe to be reasonable.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t36\n\n\t\t\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\tTable of Contents', shape=(), dtype=string)























tf.Tensor(b'ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION\n\nPlan of Operation\n\xc2\xa0\nOur goal is to expand or build our business through a variety of efforts. \xc2\xa0We are considering offerings of securities under private placements, acquisitions, and joint ventures with other public and private companies and other activities to either build sales or generate much needed capital to grow and undertake our business plan (for example, obtain, if possible, loans). We currently have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt securities and loans from our shareholders. \xc2\xa0\n\nWe have not generated any significant revenues to date and do not anticipate being able to generate significant revenues until such time as we can raise substantial additional capital and our websites are further developed and marketed. \n\nIn connection with our business plan, management will try and delay additional increases in operating expenses. We have undertaken certain actions and continue to implement changes designed to improve our financial results and operating cash flows. The actions involve certain cost-saving initiatives and growing strategies. For example, we do not have a seasoned staff of public company officers beyond the extent of experience and abilities of our Chief Executive Officer. \n\nOur financial statements contain information expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared "assuming that we will continue as a going concern," which contemplates that we satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\xc2\xa0\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to uncollectible receivables, investment values, income taxes, the recapitalization and contingencies. We base our estimates on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements.\xc2\xa0The Company does not expect the adoption of any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company\xc2\x92s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n\nIn July 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\xc2\x93FASB\xc2\x94) issued new guidance relating to the \xc2\x93FASB Accounting Standards Codification\xc2\x94 at FASB ASC 105, as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The codification is effective for interim periods ending after September 15, 2009. All existing accounting standards are superseded as described in FASB ASC 105. All other accounting literature not included in the Codification is nonauthoritative. The adoption of FASB ASC 105 did not impact Generation Zero\xc2\x92s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n\nGeneration Zero implemented FASB ASC 855, Subsequent Events. This standard establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued. The adoption of FASB ASC 855 did not impact Generation Zero\xc2\x92s financial position or results of operations. Generation Zero evaluated all events or transactions that occurred after December 31, 2010 until November 30, 2012 and has disclosed any material recognizable subsequent events.\n\n\n34\n\n\n\nRESULTS FROM OPERATIONS\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011\n\nWe generate no revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to revenues of $427,326 generated by our former wholly-owned subsidiary MedicalWork (which has since been returned to the prior owner) for the year ended December 31, 2011.\n\nThe Company had no cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2012. \xc2\xa0The Company had total cost of sales of $9,617 for the year ended December 31, 2011.\n\nWe had general and administrative expenses of $104,942 for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to general and administrative expenses of $292,627 for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $187,685 or 64% from the prior period.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The decrease in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to general and administrative expenses incurred by our former wholly-owned subsidiary MedicalWork.\n\nWe had $280,000 in amortization and depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared with depreciation expense of $280,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011. \xc2\xa0Amortization and depreciation expenses are related to the acquisition of the Find.com assets in fiscal 2010.\n\nWe had total operating expenses and a total operating loss of $384,942 for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to total operating expenses of $572,627 and a total operating loss of $154,918 for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease in total operating expenses of $187,685 from the prior period due to the reasons stated above.\n\nWe had $815,811 of forgiveness of debt for the year ended December 31, 2012 in connection with the forgiveness of $815,811 of interest owed to the Secured Noteholders pursuant to the terms of the Forbearance Amendment, described in greater detail below under \xc2\x93Liquidity and Capital Resources\xc2\x94.\n\nWe had $1,788,987 of loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 in connection with the MedicalWork rescission.\n\nWe had interest expense of $1,126,523 for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to interest expense of $1,469,760 for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease in interest expense of $343,237 from the prior period, which decrease was in connection with interest on the secured loans associated with the Notes issued in connection with the Exchange Agreement, described above under \xc2\x93Item 1. \xc2\xa0Business\xc2\x94 \xc2\x96 \xc2\x93Find.com URL Exchange Agreement\xc2\x94.\n\nWe had a total net loss of $695,654 for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to a total net loss of $3,413,666 for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease in net loss of $2,718,012 from the prior period, which was mainly due to the forgiven interest debt of $815,811 in 2012 and the $1,788,987 loss from discontinued operations recognized in 2011.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nWe had total assets of $3,573,714 as of December 31, 2012, consisting of intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization of $3,500,000 and total current assets of $73,714, consisting solely of cash.\n\n\n35\n\n\n\nWe had total liabilities as of December 31, 2012 of $3,662,212, consisting of total current liabilities of $146,962; which included $30,145 of accounts payable, $86,649 of accrued interest and $30,168 due to related party debt, which amount was owed to Matthew Krieg, the Company\xc2\x92s sole officer and Director in connection with certain loans made to the Company by Mr. Krieg, as described below; and non-current liabilities consisting of $3,515,250 of long-term notes payable as described below.\n\nWe had a working capital deficit of $73,248 and a total deficit accumulated during the development stage of $6,723,959 as of December 31, 2012. \xc2\xa0We incurred a net loss of $695,654 for the year ended December 31, 2012.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These conditions raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Management is trying to raise additional capital through sales of common and preferred stock.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if Generation Zero is unable to continue as a going concern.\n\nWe had $162,198 of net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2012, which was mainly due to a net loss of $695,654 offset by $950,335 of increase in amortization of debt discount and $705,185 of decrease in accrued liabilities.\n\nWe had $235,868 of net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012, which was mainly due to $240,000 of proceeds from issuance of debt instruments.\n\nOn June 1, 2007, we issued Capersia an $8,000 Promissory Note to evidence an $8,000 loan we received from Capersia, which has an interest rate of 6% per annum, and is payable on demand; provided that we are required to receive one (1) year and one (1) day notice prior to the due date of such note, and any amounts not paid when due accrue interest at the rate of 15% per annum. \xc2\xa0The note converts into common stock at the option of the holder (subject to the holder not holding more than 4.99% of our outstanding common stock upon conversion) at a conversion rate of $0.001 per share. On or around November 7, 2008, the Capersia Note was amended to reflect an increased amount owed to the Company of $12,764. On or around August 20, 2009, Capersia converted $1,000 of the amount owed under the note into 10,000 1:100 post-reverse split shares of our common stock. \xc2\xa0On or around November 10, 2009, Capersia sold its entire interest in the note to Cascata (50%) and Seven Palm (50%), who each subsequently converted $550 of the note into 550,000 shares of common stock each in May 2010. Additionally, in January 2011, Cascata converted an aggregate of $1,200 owed under the Capersia Note into 1,200,000 shares of common stock.\n\nOn October 23, 2010, Seven Palm agreed to cancel and forgive its portion of the Capersia Note then owed by the Company (representing a principal amount of $5,332 in its entirety prior to the accrual of any interest thereon, which accrued interest was also forgiven in connection with the Termination Agreement). As a result of the Termination Agreement, the Capersia Note is solely owned by Cascata. \xc2\xa0\n\nOn October 23, 2012, the Company exercised its right to pay-off the Caperisa Note in full and remitted payment to Cascata of $5,861 in order to cancel the Capersia Note. \xc2\xa0This amount is comprised of $4,132 in unpaid principal plus interest in the amount of $1,729 computed at 6% per annum. \xc2\xa0\n\nIn December 2009, the Company borrowed $5,000 from its sole officer and Director, Matthew Krieg.\xc2\xa0Between February and March 2010, the Company borrowed a total of $6,720 from Mr. Krieg. The amount loaned bears zero interest and is due on demand with 90 days\xc2\x92 notice. \xc2\xa0As of December 31, 2011 and 2012, a total of $30,168 and $30,168, respectively was owed to Mr. Krieg.\n\nThe Company raised the $150,000 provided to the escrow agent in connection with and pursuant to the terms of the Forbearance Agreement (described above under \xc2\x93Item 1. \xc2\xa0Business\xc2\x94 \xc2\x96 \xc2\x93Asset Purchase Agreement with Scientigo\xc2\x94) through the sale of promissory notes. A total of $150,000 was loaned to the Company in November 2010 by Gerald Modesitt, an individual, which was evidenced by a promissory note, which bears interest at the rate of 12% per annum (with interest payable monthly until maturity) and a maturity date, as extended of June 2, 2014.\n\n\n36\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Matthew Krieg, the Company\xc2\x92s sole officer and Director agreed to assign to Mr. Modesitt as of the date of the Modesitt Note, an aggregate of $100,000 which the Company owed to Mr. Krieg as of the date of the Modesitt Note, which Modesitt Note recites a principal amount of $250,000 (representing the $150,000 loaned by Mr. Modesitt and the rights to the $100,000 assigned to Mr. Modesitt by Mr. Krieg).\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Company issued Mr. Modesitt 750,000 shares of restricted common stock in connection with the Modesitt Note. \xc2\xa0As of December 31, 2011 and 2012, a total of $287,153 and $320,304 respectively, including accrued and unpaid interest thereon, was owed under the Modesitt Note.\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nAdditionally in November 2010, a third party loaned the Company $50,000, which was evidenced by a promissory note, which bears interest at the rate of 12% per annum (with interest payable monthly until maturity) and a maturity date, as extended of June 2, 2014.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Company issued the third party an aggregate of 300,000 shares of common stock in connection with the Third Party Note. As of December 31, 2011 and 2012, a total of $57,431 and $62,224 respectively, including accrued and unpaid interest thereon, was owed under the Third Party Note.\n\nAs described above under \xc2\x93Item 1. \xc2\xa0Business\xc2\x94 \xc2\x96 \xc2\x93StaffMD, Inc. Acquisition\xc2\x94, on February 4, 2011, MedicalWork, our 100% owned subsidiary and the Company entered into a Merger Agreement with StaffMD and Jeffrey Sisk, an individual, and MedicalWork, the surviving party to the merger, acquired ownership of over 60 URLs including PhysicianWork.com and its business assets. Part of the consideration paid for the acquisition was funded through the issuance of the Geronimo Note (As described above under \xc2\x93Item 1. \xc2\xa0Business\xc2\x94 \xc2\x96 \xc2\x93Geronimo Note\xc2\x94) in the amount of $250,000, which bears interest at the rate of 12% per annum, and has a default interest rate of 18% per annum. Monthly interest-only payments are due on the Geronimo Note, which was originally due February 1, 2012, but has since been automatically extended by Mr. Sisk until February 1, 2013 with timely notification and payment of an extension fee pursuant to the terms of the note (provided that Geronimo currently disputes such extension and has filed a lawsuit against the Company for payment of the note, among other things, as described in greater detail under \xc2\x93Legal Proceedings\xc2\x94, above). \xc2\xa0The Company also issued Geronimo an aggregate of 250,000 shares of the Company\xc2\x92s restricted common stock in consideration for agreeing to enter into the Geronimo Note. \xc2\xa0The Geronimo Note was secured by a security interest in all of MedicalWork\xc2\x92s assets, pursuant to a Security Agreement.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Company is a co-obligor on the Geronimo Note and remained as a secondary obligor following the parties\xc2\x92 entry into the Rescission Agreement, described below.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Company also issued Geronimo an aggregate of 250,000 shares of the Company\xc2\x92s restricted common stock in consideration for agreeing to enter into the Geronimo Note. \xc2\xa0\n\nAdditionally, as part of the Rescission Agreement , which was effective as of December 31, 2011, we released ownership of MedicalWork and its assets to Mr. Sisk, and Mr. Sisk, among other things, agreed to cancel and terminate the Seller Note and the Employment Agreement. Mr. Sisk also entered into an indemnity agreement in which Mr. Sisk indemnifies the Company from and against any claims, costs, expenses or causes of action relating to the Geronimo Note. Mr. Sisk\xc2\x92s indemnity obligation is a personal obligation and is secured by 500,000 shares of our common stock that is owned by Mr. Sisk. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is estimated that as of December 31, 2011 and 2012, there was $252,500 and $284,523 outstanding under the Geronimo Note (which is currently subject to an ongoing lawsuit as described above under \xc2\x93Legal Proceedings\xc2\x94), respectively, including accrued and unpaid interest thereon. \xc2\xa0The Company has not received verification from Mr. Sisk regarding the outstanding balances owed on this Note and the lawsuit described above alleges that approximately $357,500 is currently due pursuant to the Geronimo Note (including $250,000 of principal, $75,500 of interest and $33,000 of late charges) .\n\nThe Company was not able to meet the terms of the Forbearance Agreement and in March 2012, the Note Holders, with majority approval and the Company entered into a First Addendum to Forbearance Agreement (the \xc2\x93First Addendum\xc2\x94). \xc2\xa0Pursuant to the First Addendum, the Notes were renegotiated to represent a face value of $2,920,250. \xc2\xa0Accrued interest was forgiven and no interest accrues on the Notes during the Extended Forbearance Period. \xc2\xa0As a forbearance fee, the Company agreed to issue 1,460,125 shares of restricted common stock pro-rata with the outstanding principal amount of the Notes held by each holder, which shares have not been physically issued to date and are not included in the number of issued and outstanding shares disclosed throughout this filing..\n\n\n37\n\n\n\nFour of the Note Holders provided the Company non-interest bearing bridge loans in the aggregate amount of $40,000 in March 2012, with a maturity date of the earlier of (a) the date the Company receives aggregate funding from any source in excess of $50,000 and (b) January 2, 2014. The Company is currently in the process of obtaining waivers from the Note holders in order to allow the Company to raise additional funding for working capital purposes. In consideration for providing the loan, the Company agreed to issue the participating Note Holders an aggregate of 400,000 shares of restricted common stock, which shares have not been physically issued to date and are not included in the number of issued and outstanding shares disclosed throughout this filing. \xc2\xa0The loans are secured by a security interest in all of the Company\xc2\x92s properties and assets. As of December 31, 2012 there was $40,000 outstanding on these non-interest bearing notes.\n\nOn August 15, 2012, the Company issued a subordinated Convertible Promissory Note to John Strickland and Kimberly Ann Griffith, joint tenants, in the amount of $200,000 for working capital with some of the funds earmarked for the specific purpose of bringing the Company current in SEC filings to put the Company in a better position to raise additional funds to launch its strategic plan. The Convertible Promissory Note accrues interest at the rate of 10% per annum (payable monthly in arrears) and is due and payable on August 15, 2014. \xc2\xa0The Convertible Promissory Note is convertible into shares of the Company\xc2\x92s common stock at the option of the holder at a conversion price of $0.08 per share. As of December 31, 2012 and March 15, 2013, there was $200,000 and $200,000 outstanding on this Convertible Promissory Note respectively.\n\nAs of the date of this filing, the Company owes $2,920,250 to the Note Holders in connection with the acquisition of Find.com, the payment of which is secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets. \xc2\xa0The Company is in default in connection with the payment of the Notes, however, pursuant to the terms of a Forbearance Agreement and a First Addendum thereto, described in greater detail above under \xc2\x93Item 1. Business\xc2\x94 \xc2\x96 \xc2\x93Forbearance Agreement\xc2\x94, the Note Holders have agreed to forbear from taking any action in connection with the default during a forbearance period ending on the earlier to occur of (a) January 2, 2014 or (b) the date that any default (other than relating to the payment of funds under the Notes) occurs (the \xc2\x93Extended Forbearance Period\xc2\x94). \xc2\xa0No interest accrues on the Notes during the Extended Forbearance Period. \xc2\xa0The First Addendum also provided that all shares issued to the Note Holders from time to time have piggy-back registration rights; the Company could borrow up to $1 million in the form of a bridge loan (which is in addition to a limit of $50,000 which could be borrowed from the Note Holders, of which a total of $40,000 was subsequently borrowed), and that Mr. Krieg would effect a transfer of control by cancellation of Mr. Krieg\xc2\x92s Series A Shares and the issuance of Series A Shares to Cynthia S. White and Ronald L. Attkisson, as collateral agents for the Find.com notes (currently in default), or their assigns within 10 days of notice of such requested transfer, which has not occurred or been requested to date. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also agreed to issue Mr. Krieg 3 million shares of common stock in connection with the cancellation of his Series A Shares. We also agreed to pay the Note Holders up to 25% of our cash flow (in the discretion of the Board of Directors), in any fiscal year that revenues associated with Find.com exceed $1 million, in connection with the Notes, and the Note Holders agreed to further forebear from taking any action under the Notes and to extend the forbearance period so long as the such requirements are met. \n\nWe do not currently have any formal commitments or identified sources of additional capital from third parties or from our officer, Director or any shareholders. We can provide no assurance that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. If we are not able to raise the capital necessary to continue our business operations, we may be forced to abandon or curtail our business plan and/or suspend our activities.\n\xc2\xa0\nIn the future, we may be required to seek additional capital by selling additional debt or equity securities, selling assets, if any, or otherwise be required to bring cash flows in balance when we approach a condition of cash insufficiency. The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if accomplished, may result in dilution to our then shareholders. We provide no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\n\n\n\n38', shape=(), dtype=string)

















tf.Tensor(b'Item 7.\xc2\xa0 Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n\n\n\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with our financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this report.\xc2\xa0 The following information contains forward-looking statements. (See "Forward-Looking Statements" and "Item 1A. Risk Factors.")\n\n\n\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\n\n\n\nThis report contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company\'s views with respect to future events based upon information available to it at this time.\xc2\xa0 These forward-looking statements are subject to certain uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements.\xc2\xa0 These uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to the risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A hereof under the caption "Risk Factors."\xc2\xa0 The words "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "plans," "projects," "targets" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.\xc2\xa0 Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date the statement was made.\xc2\xa0 The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, changes in assumptions, future events or otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\n\n\nGrote Molen, Inc. ("Grote Molen") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 15, 2004. BrownWick, LLC ("BrownWick"), a wholly owned subsidiary, was formed in the State of Idaho on June 5, 2005. The principal business of Grote Molen and BrownWick (collectively the "Company") is to distribute electrical and hand operated grain mills, home kitchen mixers and related accessories for home use.\n\n\n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\n\n\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require the more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of financial statements, including the following:\n\n\n\n\nAccounts Receivable\n\n\n\n\nTrade accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful accounts. We determine the allowance for doubtful accounts by identifying potential troubled accounts and by using historical experience and future expectations applied to an aging of accounts. Trade accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of trade accounts receivable previously written off are recorded as income when received. We determined that no allowance for doubtful accounts was required at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\n\n\n\n\nInventories\n\n\n\n\nInventories, consisting primarily of grain mills, kitchen mixers, parts and accessories, are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined using primarily the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method. We purchase substantially all inventories from two foreign suppliers, and have been dependent on those suppliers for substantially all inventory purchases since we commenced operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeposits\n\n\n\n\nGenerally we are required to pay advance deposits toward the purchase of inventories from our principal suppliers. Such advance payments are recorded as deposits, a current asset in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n\n\nProperty and Equipment\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: office equipment \xe2\x80\x93 3 to 5 years; warehouse equipment \xe2\x80\x93 5 to 10 years; website development \xe2\x80\x93 3 years; and molds \xe2\x80\x93 10 years. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in operations for the period. The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to operations as incurred. Significant renewals and betterments are capitalized.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\nIntangible Assets\n\n\n\n\nIntangible assets are recorded at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization of definitive lived intangible assets is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives or contractual lives of the assets, which range from 10 to 30 years.\n\n\n\n\nOur indefinite lived intangible asset includes the cost to acquire from a German manufacturer in 2012 the license to produce a 110-volt mixer.\xc2\xa0 The license agreement stipulates that as long as the Company meets the terms of the agreement, the Company will have an exclusive license to the mixer indefinitely.\xc2\xa0 No specific legal life or term to the license is otherwise stated in the agreement.\xc2\xa0 We have concluded that no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other factors limit the useful life of this intangible asset.\xc2\xa0 We therefore have classified the license as indefinite, and are not amortizing its carrying value.\n\n\n\n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\n\n\n\nWe periodically review our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. No events or changes in circumstances have occurred to indicate that the carrying amount of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Therefore, no impairment loss was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n\n\n\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\n\n\n\nWe record revenue from the sales of grain mills, kitchen mixers and accessories in accordance with the underlying sales agreements when the products are shipped, the selling price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.\n\n\n\n\nWarranties\n\n\n\n\nWe provide limited warranties to our customers for certain of our products sold.\xc2\xa0 We perform warranty work at our service center in Pocatello, Idaho or at other authorized service locations.\xc2\xa0 Warranty expenses have not been material to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n\n\nResearch and Development Costs\n\n\n\n\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification\xe2\x84\xa2 ("ASC") Topic 730, Research and Development. The costs of materials and other costs acquired for research and development activities are charged to expense as incurred. Salaries, wages, and other related costs of personnel, as well as other facility operating costs are allocated to research and development expense through management\'s estimate of the percentage of time spent by personnel in research and development activities. We had no material research and development costs for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign Currency Transactions\n\n\n\n\nAll transactions with our foreign suppliers and customers are delineated in United States Dollars.\xc2\xa0 Therefore, there are no effects of foreign currency transactions and translations in our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nIncome Taxes\n\n\n\n\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.\n\n\n\n\nFASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires us to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position. If the more-likely-than-not threshold is met, we must measure the tax position to determine the amount to recognize in our consolidated financial statements. We performed a review of our material tax positions in accordance with recognition and measurement standards established by ASC Topic 740 and concluded we had no unrecognized tax benefit that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n\n\n\n\nWe include interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes, if any, in our consolidated statements of operations in general and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.\n\n\n\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n\n\n\n\nOur financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and notes payable. The carrying amount of cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these items. The carrying amount of the notes payable approximates fair value because the interest rates on the notes approximate market rates of interest.\n\n\n\n\nResults of Operations\n\n\n\n\nSales\n\n\n\n\nOur business is not seasonal; however, our quarterly sales, including sales to related parties, may fluctuate materially from period to period.\xc2\xa0 At times we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales to related parties.\xc2\xa0 Each of our two principal stockholders own companies that are significant customers.\xc2\xa0 Our sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were comprised of the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\n2015\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\n2014\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\nSales\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n$\n\n\n1,446,128\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\n$\n\n\n1,334,858\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\nSales to related parties\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\n81,062\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\n68,277\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\nTotal sales\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n$\n\n\n1,527,190\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\n$\n\n\n1,403,135\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSales to related parties represented approximately 5% total sales for the each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n\n\n\n\nOur total sales increased by $124,055, or approximately 9%, during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\xc2\xa0 While the increase in sales in 2015 was attributable to the successful introduction of our new WonderMix kitchen mixer, we believe there continues to be an overall slow-down in the preparedness market and continued slow economic recovery in the United States. We completed the development of the molds and the design process during the fourth quarter of 2014, and received our first shipments of the new grain mills.\xc2\xa0 We believe sales of the Wondermix will continue to increase in 2016; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these endeavors.\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost of Sales\n\n\n\n\nTotal cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1,111,422, compared to $995,605 for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $115,817, or approximately 12%.\xc2\xa0 Our cost of sales consists of the purchase price of our products incurred to our suppliers, plus inbound shipping costs.\xc2\xa0 We do not manufacture our own products.\xc2\xa0 Our costs to purchase products for resale remained relatively constant during 2015.\xc2\xa0 Therefore, the increase in our cost of sales during 2015 was primarily attributed to the increase in sales volume compared to 2014.\xc2\xa0 Included in cost of sales were cost of related party sales of $58,993 and $48,446 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\xc2\xa0 Total cost of sales as a percentage of total sales was approximately 73% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to approximately 71% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n\n\n\n\nCost of sales as a percentage of sales may fluctuate from period to period, based on the mix of products sold during a particular period and pricing arrangements with our suppliers.\xc2\xa0 In addition, we purchase substantially all inventories from two foreign suppliers, and have been dependent on those suppliers for substantially all inventory purchases since we commenced operations.\xc2\xa0 International manufacturing is subject to factors that can have a material impact on our costs of sales, including: availability of labor at costs consistent with historical levels; changes in labor or other laws; instability of social, political and economic factors; freight costs, including domestic and international customs and tariffs; unexpected changes in regulatory environments; costs and availability of manufacturing materials; and other factors.\n\n\n\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses were $304,095 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $276,371 for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $27,724, or approximately 10%.\xc2\xa0 In 2015, we incurred higher levels of professional fees, advertising and web design and hosting.\n\n\n\n\nManagement Fees to Related Parties\n\n\n\n\nPursuant to an agreement effective in February 2011, we pay a monthly management fee to a company owned by one of the major stockholders of the Company to manage our day-to-day business activities and to provide business space.\xc2\xa0 Historically we have paid monthly management fees in varying amounts to this related party pursuant to prior agreements.\xc2\xa0 The agreement is on a month-to-month basis and can be cancelled at any time by the vote of management.\xc2\xa0 The agreement was amended and restated on October 31, 2014 to increase the monthly fee from $10,700 to $12,500 effective November 1, 2014.\xc2\xa0 Also included in management fees are monthly payments of $150 to another major stockholder of the Company for expense reimbursement.\xc2\xa0 Management fees to related parties totaled $151,800 and $133,800 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $18,016 and $6,763 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with the increase attributable to placing the molds for the new kitchen mixers in service during the fourth quarter of 2014.\n\n\n\n\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\n\n\n\nResearch and development activities are not currently significant to our business.\xc2\xa0 We did not incur material research and development expenses in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n\n\n\n\nOther Expense\n\n\n\n\nOther expense includes interest expense on our indebtedness, a significant portion of which is indebtedness to related parties.\xc2\xa0 Total interest expense \xe2\x80\x93 related parties was $10,628 and $14,679 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\xc2\xa0 The decrease in interest expense to related parties is due to repayments on both current and long-term debt to related parties in the current year.\xc2\xa0 Total interest expense to non-related parties was $15,009 and $12,597 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\xc2\xa0 The increase in interest expense to non-related parties is due to the increase in debt to non-related parties in the current year. \n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had total current assets of $822,115, including cash of $9,251, and current liabilities of $420,333, resulting in working capital of $401,782.\xc2\xa0 Our current assets and working capital included inventories of $708,893 and deposits of $64,685.\xc2\xa0 Generally, we are required to pay significant advance deposits toward the purchase of inventories from our principal suppliers.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2015, we had total stockholders\' equity of $459,399.\xc2\xa0 We have financed our operations, the acquisition of inventories, and the payment of vendor deposits from our operations, short-term loans from our principal stockholders and non-related parties, a long-term note payable from a bank, and from the issuance of our common stock.\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in operating activities was $30,209, as a result of our net loss of $52,120 and increases in inventories of $380,733, partially offset by non-cash expenses of $18,016, decreases in accounts receivable of $17,652, accounts receivable \xe2\x80\x93 related parties of $1,776, deposits of $317,610 and prepaid expenses of $6,579, and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $23,949, accrued interest payable \xe2\x80\x93 related parties of $8,571 and accrued interest payable of $8,491.\n\n\n\n\nBy comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash used in operating activities was $222,958, as a result of our net loss of $42,576, increases in accounts receivable of $1,172, accounts receivable \xe2\x80\x93 related parties of $3,294, inventories of $39,641 and deposits of $178,660, and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $20,263, partially offset by non-cash expenses totaling $9,294, a decrease in prepaid expenses of $38,198, and increases in accrued interest payable \xe2\x80\x93 related parties of $9,382 and accrued interest payable of $5,774.\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we had net cash used in investing activities of $1,423, comprised of the purchase of property and equipment.\xc2\xa0 We had no net cash provided by or used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\n\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in financing activities was $21,348, comprised of repayment of notes payable \xe2\x80\x93 related parties of $24,500, repayment of long-term debt \xe2\x80\x93 related party of $49,734 and repayment of long-term note payable of $20,314, partially offset by proceeds from long-term note payable of $28,700 and proceeds from notes payable of $44,500.\n\n\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $206,120, comprised of proceeds from long-term note payable of $151,930, proceeds from notes payable \xe2\x80\x93 related parties of $50,000, proceeds from notes payable of $19,600 and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $60,000, partially offset by repayment of notes payable \xe2\x80\x93 related parties of $15,000, repayment of long-term debt \xe2\x80\x93 related party of $42,702 and repayment of long-term note payable of $17,708.\n\n\n\n\nAt December 31, 2015, we had short-term notes payable \xe2\x80\x93 related parties totaling $130,127, which are payable to our principal stockholders, are unsecured, bear interest at rates ranging from 6% to 8% per annum and are generally due on demand.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, at December 31, 2015, we had short-term notes payable to non-related parties totaling $136,100, which are unsecured, bear interest at rates ranging from 6% to 8% per annum and are due on demand.\n\n\n\n\nAt December 31, 2015, our long-term debt \xe2\x80\x93 related party was comprised of the remaining principal balance of $2,943 of a note payable to a principal stockholder.\xc2\xa0 The note bears interest at 6.97% per annum and was paid in full in February 2016.\n\n\n\n\nAt December 31, 2015, we had a long-term note payable to a bank with a principal balance of $145,139.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The long-term note payable is a line of credit promissory note bearing interest at an indexed rate plus 2% (4.5% at December 31, 2015), requiring monthly interest payments only\xc2\xa0and maturing on May 16, 2021.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the past several months, we have made monthly payments of principal and interest of $5,000.\xc2\xa0 The note payable has an available line of credit of $150,000 and is secured by a deed of trust on certain real estate owned by one of the principal stockholders of the Company and by the Company\'s inventories, property and equipment, and intangible assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccrued interest payable \xe2\x80\x93 related parties was $53,507 and $44,936 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\xc2\xa0 Accrued interest payable to non-related parties was $22,686 and $14,195 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n\n\n\n\nIn the event sales during 2016 do not meet our expectations, we may require additional funding from the sale of our common stock or debt in order to meet our obligations.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Depending on the requirement to pay advance deposits on orders from our suppliers, we estimate we may require $50,000 to $100,000 of additional funding in 2016.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No assurances can be given that, if required, such funding will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n\n\n\nIn July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-11, "Inventory (Topic 330), Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory."\xc2\xa0 An entity is required to measure inventory within the scope of this Update at the lower of cost and net realizable value.\xc2\xa0 Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.\xc2\xa0 Other than the change in the subsequent measurement guidance from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value for inventory within the scope of this Update, there are no other substantive changes to the guidance on measurement of inventory.\xc2\xa0 For public companies, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.\xc2\xa0 The amendments in this Update are to be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.\xc2\xa0 We are currently unable to determine the impact on our consolidated financial statements of the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement.\n\n\n\n\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)".\xc2\xa0 ASU 2014-09 amends the guidance for revenue recognition to replace numerous, industry-specific requirements and converges areas under this topic with those of the International Financial Reporting Standards. The ASU implements a five-step process for customer contract revenue recognition that focuses on transfer of control, as opposed to transfer of risk and rewards. The amendment also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. Other major provisions include the capitalization and amortization of certain contract costs, ensuring the time value of money is considered in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. The amendments in this ASU are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016; however, in July 2015, the FASB agreed to delay the effective date by one year.

Item\xc2\xa01A. Risk Factors\xe2\x80\x9d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All references to produced tons, sold tons, or cash cost per ton sold refer to clean tons of coal. \n\xc2\xa0\nOverview \n\xc2\xa0\nForesight Energy LLC (\xe2\x80\x9cFELLC\xe2\x80\x9d), a perpetual-term Delaware limited liability company, was formed in September\xc2\xa02006 for the development, mining, transportation and sale of coal. Prior to June 23, 2014, Foresight Reserves owned 99.333% of FELLC and a member of FELLC\xe2\x80\x99s management owned 0.667%. On June\xc2\xa023,\xc2\xa02014, in connection with the initial public offering (\xe2\x80\x9cIPO\xe2\x80\x9d) of Foresight Energy LP (\xe2\x80\x9cFELP\xe2\x80\x9d), Foresight Reserves and a member of FELLC\xe2\x80\x99s management contributed their ownership interests in FELLC to FELP in exchange for common and subordinated units in FELP. Because this transaction was between entities under common control, the contributed assets and liabilities of FELLC were recorded in the combined consolidated financial statements of FELP at FELLC\xe2\x80\x99s historical cost. FELP has been managed by Foresight Energy GP LLC (\xe2\x80\x9cFEGP\xe2\x80\x9d) subsequent to the IPO. \n\xc2\xa0\nOn April 16, 2015, Murray Energy Corporation (\xe2\x80\x9cMurray Energy\xe2\x80\x9d) and Foresight Reserves completed a transaction whereby Murray Energy acquired a 34% noncontrolling economic interest in FEGP and all of the outstanding subordinated units of FELP, representing a 50% ownership percentage of the Partnership\xe2\x80\x99s limited partner units.\n\xc2\xa0\nThe presented financial results include the combined financial position, results of operations and cash flow information of FELP and FELLC and its subsidiaries for all periods presented. In this Item 7, all references to \xe2\x80\x9cFELP,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cPartnership,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwe,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cus,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cour\xe2\x80\x9d refer to the combined results of FELP and FELLC and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires or where otherwise indicated.\n\xc2\xa0\nWe control 2.1 billion tons of coal reserves, almost all of which exist in three large, contiguous blocks of coal: two in central Illinois and one in southern Illinois. Since our inception, we have invested significantly in capital expenditures to develop what we believe are industry-leading, geologically similar, low-cost and highly productive mines and related infrastructure. We currently operate under one reportable segment with four underground mining complexes in the Illinois Basin: Williamson, Sugar Camp and Hillsboro, all three of which are longwall operations, and Macoupin, which is currently a continuous miner operation. The Williamson and Hillsboro complexes each operates with one longwall system and Sugar Camp operates with two longwall mining systems. Mining operations at our Hillsboro complex have been idle since March 2015 due to a combustion event. We are uncertain as to when production will resume at this operation\n\xc2\xa0\nOur coal is sold to a diverse customer base, including electric utility and industrial companies in the eastern half of the United States as well as internationally (primarily into Europe). We generally sell a majority of our coal to customers at delivery points other than our mines, including, but not limited to, our river terminal on the Ohio River and ports near New Orleans.\n\xc2\xa0\nDebt Restructuring \n\xc2\xa0\nOn December 4, 2015, the Delaware Court of Chancery issued a memorandum opinion concluding, among other things, that the purchase and sale agreement between Foresight Reserves and Murray Energy constituted a \xe2\x80\x9cchange of control\xe2\x80\x9d under the indenture (the \xe2\x80\x9c2021 Senior Notes Indenture\xe2\x80\x9d) governing our 7.875% Senior Notes due 2021 (the \xe2\x80\x9c2021 Senior Notes\xe2\x80\x9d) and that an event of default occurred under the 2021 Senior Notes Indenture when we failed to offer to purchase the 2021 Senior Notes on or about May\xc2\xa018,\xc2\xa02015 (the \xe2\x80\x9c2015 Delaware Court of Chancery change-of-control litigation\xe2\x80\x9d). Because of the existence of \xe2\x80\x9cchange of control\xe2\x80\x9d provisions and cross-default or cross-event of default provisions in our debt agreements, the purchase and sale agreement between Foresight Reserves and Murray Energy also resulted, directly or indirectly, in events of default under FELLC\xe2\x80\x99s credit agreement governing its senior secured credit facilities (the \xe2\x80\x9cCredit Agreement\xe2\x80\x9d), Foresight Receivables LLC\xe2\x80\x99s securitization program and certain other financing arrangements, including our longwall financing arrangements. The existence of an event of default prohibited us access to borrowings or other extensions of credit under our revolving credit facility and our failure to pay the semi-annual interest payments of $23.6 million due on February 15, 2016 and August 15, 2016 resulted in additional events of default. \n\xc2\xa0\nOn August\xc2\xa030, 2016 (the \xe2\x80\x9cClosing Date\xe2\x80\x9d), we completed a global restructuring of our indebtedness. The restructuring transactions (the \xe2\x80\x9cRestructuring Transactions\xe2\x80\x9d) alleviated existing defaults and events of default across the Partnership\xe2\x80\x99s capital structure that resulted from the 2015 Delaware Chancery Court change-of-control litigation related to the purchase and sale agreement between \n50\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\nForesight Reserves and Murray Energy. See \xe2\x80\x9cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data \xe2\x80\x93 Note 10. Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cItem 8. Financial Statements \xe2\x80\x93 Note 15. Related-Party Transactions\xe2\x80\x9d for additional discussion of the Restructuring Transactions.\n\xc2\xa0\nFactors That Affect Our Results \n\xc2\xa0\nCoal Sales. In recent years, domestic coal prices overall have weakened due to reduced demand from coal-fired plants and increased competition from natural gas. International prices have also declined significantly as a result of excess supply in the marketplace. More recently, coal prices have remained flat and in some instances increased slightly as supply and demand dynamics have become more balanced.\n\xc2\xa0\nDemand for coal can increase due to unusually hot or cold weather as consumers use more electricity to air condition or heat their homes. Conversely, mild weather can result in softer demand for our coal. Adverse weather conditions, such as blizzards or floods, can affect our ability to mine and ship our coal and our customers\xe2\x80\x99 ability to take delivery of coal. \n\xc2\xa0\nCost of Coal Sales (Excluding Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization). Our cost of coal sales (excluding depreciation, depletion and amortization) includes, but is not limited to, labor and benefits, supplies, repairs, utilities, insurance, equipment rental, mine lease costs (royalties), property and subsidence costs, production taxes, belting, coal preparation and direct mine overhead. Each of these cost components has its own drivers, which can include the cost and availability of labor, changes in health care and insurance regulations and costs, the cost of consumable items or inputs into our supplies, changes in regulations impacting our industry, and/or our staffing levels. In addition, geology can unfavorably impact our costs by requiring incremental roof control support and higher water handling and equipment maintenance expenses. Certain of our royalties are dependent directly upon the price at which we sell our coal and our cost to transport the coal to our customers, in addition to having minimum payment requirements.\n\xc2\xa0\nA variety of actions taken by regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, climate change regulation, challenges to the issuance or renewal of our permits to operate and regulations governing the operations of our mines, could substantially increase compliance costs for us and our customers, reduce general demand for coal, or interrupt operations at one or more of our mining complexes. \n\xc2\xa0\nTransportation. We generally sell our coal to customers at three distinct delivery points: either at our mines, at river terminals on the Ohio River, or at export terminals near New Orleans. Except for those sales that occur at our mine, we generally bear the transportation cost and risk to and through these terminals and we therefore do not report coal sales and transportation revenue separately in our consolidated statements of operations. Also, because we are responsible for the cost of transporting our coal to these various delivery points, we also bear the risk that our transportation expense will increase over time. Where possible, we enter into long-term transportation and throughput agreements to secure capacity and price certainty. These agreements generally require throughput of minimum annual volumes. Failure to meet the minimum annual volume requirements can result in higher transportation costs to us on a per ton basis. The primary reason for entering into minimum annual volume commitments is to secure long-term access to international markets and provide optionality between the domestic and international coal markets. To the extent coal pricing to international markets does not continue to improve, we will continue to incur substantial expenses for shortfalls on minimum contractual throughput volume requirements related to the export market.\n\xc2\xa0\n Our transportation costs also correlate to the distance required to transport our coal to the buyers. As a result, the transport of our coal to domestic buyers has lower associated costs than the transport of our coal to international buyers. International sales incur higher transportation costs because the delivery requires us to transport coal first by rail to a seaborne export terminal and then load the coal onto the buyers\xe2\x80\x99 ships. In certain circumstances, the cost of transporting our coal to international buyers can be twice the cost of transporting our coal to domestic buyers. \n\xc2\xa0\n51\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expense consists of our general corporate overhead expenses, including, but not limited to, management and administrative labor, corporate occupancy expenses, office expenses, and certain professional fees. Prior to Murray Energy\xe2\x80\x99s investment in the Partnership, all selling, general and administrative costs were variable based on actual costs incurred. In April 2015, a management services agreement (\xe2\x80\x9cMSA\xe2\x80\x9d) was executed between FEGP and Murray American Coal, Inc. (the \xe2\x80\x9cManager\xe2\x80\x9d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Murray Energy, pursuant to which the Manager provides certain management and administration services to FELP for a quarterly fee, which is currently $3.5 million ($14.1 million on an annual basis), and is subject to future contractual escalations and adjustments. To the extent that FELP or FEGP directly incurs costs for any services covered under the MSA, then the Manager\xe2\x80\x99s quarterly fee is reduced accordingly. Also, to the extent that the Manager utilizes outside service providers to perform any of the services under the MSA, the Manager is responsible for those outside service provider costs.\n\xc2\xa0\nKey Metrics \n\xc2\xa0\nWe assess the performance of our business using certain key metrics, which are described below and analyzed on a period-to -period basis. These key metrics include Adjusted EBITDA, production, tons sold, coal sales realization per ton sold, netback to mine realization per ton sold and cash cost per ton sold. Coal sales realization per ton sold is defined as coal sales divided by tons sold. Netback to mine realization per ton sold is defined as coal sales less transportation expense divided by tons sold. Cash cost per ton sold is defined as cost of coal produced (excluding depreciation, depletion and amortization) divided by produced tons sold.\n\xc2\xa0\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to controlling interests before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion. Adjusted EBITDA is also adjusted for equity-based compensation, losses/gains on commodity derivative contracts, settlements of derivative contracts, changes in the fair value of the warrants and material nonrecurring or other items which may not reflect the trend of future results. As it relates to derivatives, the Adjusted EBITDA calculation removes the total impact of derivative gains/losses on net income (loss) during the period and then adds/deducts to Adjusted EBITDA the aggregate settlements during the period. Included in net loss (income) attributable to controlling interests during 2016 were insurances recoveries for the reimbursement of mitigation costs of $10.5 million, which was recorded in cost of coal sales (excluding depreciation, depletion and amortization), and business interruption proceeds of $20.0 million which was recorded in other operating income, net.\n\xc2\xa0\n Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance defined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our performance because it is a commonly used financial analysis tool for measuring and comparing companies in our industry in areas of operating performance. Management believes that the disclosure of Adjusted EBITDA offers an additional view of our operations that, when coupled with our U.S. GAAP results and the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of our results of operations and the factors and trends affecting our business. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss). The primary limitation associated with the use of Adjusted EBITDA as compared to U.S. GAAP results are (i) it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry, and (ii) it excludes financial information that some consider important in evaluating our performance. We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to U.S. GAAP results to enable users to perform their own analysis of our operating results.\n\xc2\xa0\nResults of Operations\n\xc2\xa0\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2016 to Year Ended December 31, 2015\n\xc2\xa0\nCoal Sales.

Coal sales realization per ton sold improved slightly from 2015 due to an improvement in export pricing during the second half of 2016.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Offsetting the improved export pricing was a lower mix of international sales volumes during the current year. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold 17% of our coal to export markets as compared to 24% during 2015.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nOther Revenues. Other revenues of $9.2 million and $5.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, was primarily comprised of overriding royalty and lease revenues earned on the financing agreements entered into with affiliates of Murray Energy in April 2015.

The improvement in cash cost per ton sold was driven by increased production at our non-Hillsboro mines which allowed for better leveraging of fixed costs and additional synergies related to the transaction with Murray Energy, including lower mine overhead costs and operational efficiencies.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Additionally, the direct and indirect costs of the Hillsboro combustion event during 2016 were offset by $10.5 million in insurance recoveries for the reimbursement of mitigation costs.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nTransportation. Our cost of transportation for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower sales volumes. There was a decrease in transportation cost per ton sold during the current year due to lower international sales volumes, offset partially by $15.1\xc2\xa0million of higher charges for shortfalls on minimum contractual throughput volumes during 2016.\n\xc2\xa0\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization. The decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense from 2015 was due to the decrease in tons sold during the year ended December 31, 2016, which resulted in less depreciation, depletion and amortization being released from coal inventory as well as the impact of certain assets becoming fully depreciated.\n\xc2\xa0\nSelling, General and Administrative. The $6.1 million decline in selling, general and administrative expenses from the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to a $7.1 million fully-vested equity award granted to the Partnership\xe2\x80\x99s former chief executive officer during the first quarter of 2015. \n\xc2\xa0\nLong-lived Asset Impairments. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $74.6\xc2\xa0million and $11.6\xc2\xa0million, respectively, related to certain prepaid royalties for which we determined recoupment was improbable. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a charge to write-off the remaining $1.0\xc2\xa0million in deferred longwall costs related to Hillsboro\xe2\x80\x99s current longwall panel, which is being abandoned as a result of the combustion event at the mine.\n53\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\nTransition and Reorganization Costs. As part of the Murray Energy transaction, we entered into the MSA with Murray Energy with the intent of optimizing and reorganizing certain corporate administrative functions and generating synergies between the two companies through the elimination of headcount and duplicative selling, general and administrative costs. Transition and reorganization costs were $6.9 million for the year ended December 31,\xc2\xa02016, as compared to $21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The costs for the current year period were comprised of the remaining retention compensation to certain employees during the transition period. Included in transition and reorganization costs for the year ended December 31,\xc2\xa02016 were $2.3\xc2\xa0million of costs paid by Foresight Reserves which were recorded as capital contributions, $4.3\xc2\xa0million of equity-based compensation for the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards, and $0.2 million of other one-time charges related to the Murray Energy transaction. \n\xc2\xa0\nLoss (Gain) on Commodity Derivative Contracts. We recorded a loss on our commodity derivative contracts of $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a gain of $45.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The loss during the current year was due to a substantial increase in the API 2 forward price curve during the second half of 2016, whereas during the prior year the API 2 forward price curve declined substantially. For the year ended December 31,\xc2\xa02016 and 2015, we had settlements of $12.6 million and $61.2 million, respectively, on commodity derivative contracts.\n\xc2\xa0\nOther Operating Income, Net. We recorded other operating income of $22.2 million for the year ended December\xc2\xa031,\xc2\xa02016, compared to $13.4 million during the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $20.0\xc2\xa0million of other operating income related to business interruption insurance recoveries from the Hillsboro combustion event, which has idled the mine since March 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a $13.5 million favorable legal settlement with Murray Energy.\n\xc2\xa0\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $31.9 million from the prior year period due primarily to higher effective interest rates under the new and amended debt instruments as well as higher interest rates charged on the term loan, revolving credit facility and A/R securitization facility borrowings prior to the Closing Date of the debt restructuring due to default interest rates being in effect.\n\xc2\xa0\nDebt Restructuring Costs. The $21.8 million and $3.9 million of debt restructuring costs incurred during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, represents legal and other advisor fees incurred as a result of the unfavorable ruling under the 2015 Delaware Court of Chancery change-of-control litigation.\n\xc2\xa0\nChange in fair value of warrants. The warrants issued as part of the Restructuring Transactions are required to be accounted for as a liability at fair value and the fair value must be revalued at each balance sheet date until the earlier of the exercise of the warrants, their expiration, or until any feature requiring liability treatments expires or is modified. The resulting non-cash gain or loss on the fair value revaluation at each balance sheet date is recorded as non-operating expense in our consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2016, a loss of $17.1 million was recorded to adjust the warrants to fair value, which was primarily driven by the increase in the unit price of our stock subsequent to the Closing Date of the Restructuring Transactions. \n\xc2\xa0\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt. The $13.2 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to the write-off of $11.1 million of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs associated with the extinguishment of the 2021 Senior Notes and the reduction in borrowing capacity under our revolving facilities as well as the incurrence of $2.1 million in costs related to the modification of debt which were not deferred. \n\xc2\xa0\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA declined $29.6 million from the prior year due primarily to lower sales volumes and less favorable coal derivative contract settlements during the current year.

The decline in coal sales realization per ton was due to a decline in realization per ton on both our domestic and international sales driven by weak coal market conditions as well as a lower mix of international shipments. Increased domestic shipments during the year ended December 31, 2015 offset the 1.3\xc2\xa0million ton decrease in sales volumes to international markets from the year ended December 31, 2014. The decline in tons sold to the international market resulted in a corresponding decline in transportation expense during the year ended December 31, 2015, therefore, the netback to mine realization per ton sold decreased to a lesser extent than the coal sales realization per ton sold.\n\xc2\xa0\nOther Revenues.

The impact of the Hillsboro mine combustion event and increased costs at our Williamson and Sugar Camp operations primarily accounted for the increase in the cash cost per ton sold. The direct costs incurred during 2015 from our efforts to extinguish the fire at our Hillsboro mine was $20.2 million and the indirect impact of incurring salary and overhead costs at this mine without any corresponding production was $10.6 million. The higher cash cost per ton sold at our Williamson and Sugar Camp operations was driven by higher repairs, maintenance and longwall costs during the year ended December 31, 2015. Partially offsetting the higher costs discussed above was an $8.4\xc2\xa0million favorable adjustment related to a refund from our utility provider during 2015.\n\xc2\xa0\nTransportation. Transportation expense declined $49.4 million, or $2.21 per ton sold, from the year ended December 31, 2014 due to a 19.4% decline in international sales as well as lower charges during the year ended December 31, 2015 for shortfalls against contractual minimum volumes as a result of a favorable contractual amendment to reduce the required minimum volumes through Convent Marine Terminal (\xe2\x80\x9cCMT\xe2\x80\x9d), the export terminal owned by an affiliate prior to September 2015.\n\xc2\xa0\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization. The increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense of $25.6 million from 2014 was primarily due to the reduction of coal inventory during 2015 and the second longwall at our Sugar Camp complex coming out of development in June 2014.\n\xc2\xa0\nLong-lived Asset Impairments. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded an impairment charge of $11.6\xc2\xa0million and $34.7\xc2\xa0million, respectively, related to certain Hillsboro prepaid royalties for which we determined recoupment was improbable. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a charge to write-off the remaining $1.0\xc2\xa0million in deferred longwall costs related to Hillsboro\xe2\x80\x99s current longwall panel, which is being abandoned as a result of the mine fire.\n\xc2\xa0\nTransition and Reorganization Costs. Transition and reorganization costs were $21.4 million for the year ended December\xc2\xa031,\xc2\xa02015. As part of the Murray Energy transaction, Foresight entered into the MSA with Murray Energy with the intent of optimizing and reorganizing certain corporate administrative functions and generating synergies between the two companies through the elimination of headcount and duplicate selling, general and administrative costs. The costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 are primarily comprised of retention compensation to certain employees during the transition period and termination benefits to employees whose positions were replaced by Murray Energy employees under the MSA. Included in these retention costs were $5.9\xc2\xa0million of retention and transition salaries paid by FELP, $10.0 million of retention and severance costs paid by Foresight Reserves (which were recorded as capital contributions), $4.3 million of equity-based compensation for the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards, and $1.2\xc2\xa0million of legal and various other one-time charges related to the Murray Energy transaction. \n\xc2\xa0\nGain on Commodity Derivative Contracts. We recorded a gain on our commodity derivative contracts of $45.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a $76.3 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2014. The API 2 coal index forward price curve declined significantly during both fiscal year 2015 and 2014, resulting in the large derivative gains. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had settlements of $61.2\xc2\xa0million on our commodity derivative contracts, of which $19.1 million were for coal derivative contracts settled prior to their contractual maturities.\n\xc2\xa0\n56\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\nOther Operating Income, Net. Other operating income, net increased $10.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a $13.5 million favorable legal settlement with Murray Energy during the first quarter of 2015.\n\xc2\xa0\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $4.3 million from the prior year due primarily to higher interest charges on our Macoupin sale-leaseback obligation and lower interest charges capitalized in 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we capitalized $1.9 million in interest expense as compared to $5.2 million during the prior year. The decrease in capitalized interest was due to capital spending on the development of Sugar Camp\xe2\x80\x99s second longwall mine along with the acquisition of an additional set of longwall shields during 2014.\n\xc2\xa0\nDebt Restructuring Costs. The $3.9 million of debt restructuring costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015 represents legal and other advisor fees incurred as a result of the unfavorable ruling under the 2021 Senior Note bondholder lawsuit, including the negotiations with all of our creditors as a result of the default and the evaluation of our alternatives with respect to the restructuring of our indebtedness.\n\xc2\xa0\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA declined $71.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 due to lower netback to mine realizations per ton sold and higher cash cost per ton sold during the year ended December 31, 2015. Partially offsetting the above was $42.0 million of incremental settlements on commodity derivative contracts and a favorable $13.5 million legal settlement with Murray Energy during 2015.

The consummation of the Restructuring Transactions on August 30, 2016 alleviated certain defaults and events of default across the Partnership\xe2\x80\x99s capital structure, which restored our access to borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, which had been restricted since December 2015. The commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility, which terminates in August 2018, were reduced by $100.0 million to $450.0 million effective December 31, 2016. During 2016, management focused on the preservation and growth of our liquidity. As of December 31,\xc2\xa02016, we had $103.7 million of cash on hand and unused capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility of $90.5 million. The August\xc2\xa030,\xc2\xa02016 amendment to the credit agreement (\xe2\x80\x9cAmended Credit Agreement\xe2\x80\x9d) put in place an anti-hoarding provision, which prohibits new borrowings if the aggregate amount of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (taking into account certain pending applications of cash) exceeds $35.0\xc2\xa0million both before and after giving effect to such borrowing when taking into account the intended use of such loan proceeds for bona fide purposes within 60 days.  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nMandatory term loan prepayments are required to be made under our Term Loan based on an excess cash flow calculation, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, for the second half of fiscal year 2016 and full fiscal year 2017, sales of assets, net \n57\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\nproceeds of insurance and condemnation awards and certain incurrence of indebtedness, subject, in each case, to customary exceptions and thresholds. The excess cash flow generated during the second half of fiscal year 2016 and business interruption insurance recoveries from the Hillsboro combustion event require that we prepay $26.9 million of Term Loan principal, $2.1 million of which was paid in 2016 and the remainder is due during the first quarter of 2017.\n\xc2\xa0\nOn February 13, 2017, we announced that we have commenced the process to refinance and extend the maturities of all or a portion of our existing indebtedness with the net proceeds from a combination of debt, equity financing and/or cash on hand.\xc2\xa0There can be no assurance regarding the results of the Partnership\xe2\x80\x99s refinancing and maturity extension efforts.\n\xc2\xa0\nOur operations are capital intensive, requiring investments to expand, maintain or enhance existing operations and to meet environmental and operational regulations. Our future capital spending will be determined by the board of directors of our general partner. Our capital requirements consist of maintenance and expansion capital expenditures. Maintenance capital expenditures are cash expenditures made to maintain our then-current operating capacity or net income as they exist at such time as the capital expenditures are made. Our maintenance capital expenditures can be irregular, causing the amount spent to differ materially from period to period. \n\xc2\xa0\nExpansion capital expenditures are cash expenditures made to increase, over the long-term, our operating capacity or net income as it exists at such time as the capital expenditures are made. Expansion capital expenditures have declined significantly since early-2015 and no significant expansion capital expenditure plans are currently planned. Future longwall development and the associated expansion capital expenditures will be dependent upon several factors, including permitting, demand, access to capital, equipment availability and the committed sales position at our existing mining operations. \n\xc2\xa0\nDistributions\n\xc2\xa0\nOur Senior Secured Credit Facilities, as amended on August 30, 2016, prohibit certain restricted payments, including discretionary dividends, until the later to occur of: (i)\xc2\xa0June\xc2\xa030,\xc2\xa02018 and (ii)\xc2\xa0the date on which our obligations under our revolving credit facility have been paid in full, after which restricted payments can be made of up to $25.0 million per year, subject to certain adjustments and exceptions. Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities allow for the payment of certain tax distributions during 2017 and 2018.\n\xc2\xa0\nThe following is a summary of cash provided by or used in each of the indicated types of activities during the years ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016, 2015, and 2014. \n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n2016\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n2015\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n2014\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n(In Thousands)\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n\n$\n\n225,220\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n$\n\n200,412\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n$\n\n240,782\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nNet cash used in investing activities\n\n$\n\n(47,629\n\n)\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n$\n\n(138,781\n\n)\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n$\n\n(224,583\n\n)\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nNet cash used in financing activities\n\n$\n\n(91,439\n\n)\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n$\n\n(70,602\n\n)\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n$\n\n(14,477\n\n)\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\nCash provided by operating activities increased $24.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as the decline in net income, excluding non-cash items, during the current year was impacted significantly by the variances in working capital accounts and certain financing activities, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x97\x8f\n\n$49.2 million of interest from the 2021 Senior Notes that was converted into new debt as part of the August 30, 2016 debt restructuring ($17.7 million of which was accrued for at December 31, 2015 and the remainder was a noncash financing transaction);\n\n\n\n\xe2\x97\x8f\n\n$38.3 million favorable change in due from/to affiliates, net, which is a function of timing of cash collections;\n\n\n\n\xe2\x97\x8f\n\nFavorable change in accrued interest driven by accrued PIK interest on the Exchangeable PIK Notes and the Second Lien Notes (will convert to principal in 2017);\n\n\n\n\xe2\x97\x8f\n\n$20.1 million unfavorable change in inventories. Inventories lowered during both 2016 and 2015 however the impact was more significant during the prior year as coal stockpiles were depleted due to the combustion event at Hillsboro and coal production cuts in December 2015 to preserve liquidity and drawdown the excess coal inventory at our other mine sites.\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $47.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $138.8\xc2\xa0million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decline in net cash used in investing activities was in part due to a $30.4\xc2\xa0million reduction in capital expenditures due to expansion capital for the second longwall mine at our Sugar Camp complex coming to an end in 2015, the strict controlling of maintenance capital expenditures to preserve liquidity, and the shutdown of production at our Hillsboro mine due \n58\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\nto the combustion event. During 2016, we also received $4.4 million in cash proceeds from the sale of certain corporate assets. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we made a $75.0\xc2\xa0million investment in the Murray Energy transport lease and overriding royalty agreements (see \xe2\x80\x9cItem 8. Financial Statements \xe2\x80\x93 Note 15. Related-Party Transactions\xe2\x80\x9d) and received $19.1\xc2\xa0million in proceeds from the settlement of certain outstanding derivative contracts prior to the economically hedged sale transaction occurring. \n\xc2\xa0\nNet cash used in financing activities was $91.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $70.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we repaid $26.8\xc2\xa0million of principal under our A/R securitization program and $45.7\xc2\xa0million of principal under our longwall financing and capital lease arrangements. We also incurred debt issuance costs of $15.7 million directly related to the debt restructuring. During the year ended December\xc2\xa031,\xc2\xa02015, we increased our net borrowings by $86.3 million and paid distributions of $152.4\xc2\xa0million. \n\xc2\xa0\nNet cash provided by operating activities declined $40.4 million to $200.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to lower net income, excluding non-cash items, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The impact of lower earnings was offset partially by favorable variances in working capital accounts from 2014, including $40.0\xc2\xa0million in cash proceeds from the settlement of derivative contracts during 2015 and a $41.8 million favorable variance in inventory as Hillsboro\xe2\x80\x99s coal stockpiles were depleted due to the mine fire and coal production was cut in December 2015 to preserve liquidity and drawdown the excess coal inventory at the other mine sites. \n\xc2\xa0\nNet cash used in investing activities was $138.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $224.6\xc2\xa0million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decline in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a $144.7 million reduction in capital expenditures as a result of the second longwall mine at our Sugar Camp complex emerging from development in June 2014 as well as the receipt of $19.1 million in proceeds during 2015 from the settlement of certain outstanding coal derivative contracts. The cash receipts on these contracts were recorded as an investing activity given they were settled prior to the economically hedged sale transaction occurring. Offsetting the items above was a $75.0 million investment in the Murray Energy transport lease and overriding royalty agreements (see Part II. \xe2\x80\x9cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\xe2\x80\x93 Note 15. Related-Party Transactions\xe2\x80\x9d of this Annual Report on Form\xc2\xa010-K). \n\xc2\xa0\nNet cash used in financing activities was $70.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $14.5 million used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we received net proceeds from our A/R securitization program of $41.0 million, increased our borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility by $33.0\xc2\xa0million and received proceeds from incremental term loan borrowings of $59.3 million. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we repaid $44.4\xc2\xa0million under our longwall financing and capital lease arrangements, repaid $2.6 million in short-term insurance financing, paid $2.8 million in debt issuance costs and paid $152.4 million in distributions to our limited partners and noncontrolling interests. The increased borrowings during 2015 were due in part to the $75.0\xc2\xa0million invested in the Murray Energy transport lease and overriding royalty agreements.\n\xc2\xa0\nLong-Term Debt and Sale-Leaseback Financing Arrangements \n\xc2\xa0\nOn August\xc2\xa030, 2016, we completed a global restructuring of our indebtedness. The Restructuring Transactions alleviated then existing defaults and events of default across the Partnership\xe2\x80\x99s capital structure that resulted from the 2015 Delaware Court of Chancery change-of-control litigation related to the purchase and sale agreement between Foresight Reserves and Murray Energy. As a result of the Restructuring Transactions and the resolution of the 2015 Delaware Court of Chancery change-of-control litigation, certain of our outstanding long-term debt and capital lease obligations were no longer reflected as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheets and we were no longer subject to default interest rates.\n\xc2\xa0\nOn February 13, 2017, we announced that we have commenced the process to refinance and extend the maturities of all or a portion of our existing indebtedness with the net proceeds from a combination of debt, equity financing and/or cash on hand.\xc2\xa0There can be no assurance regarding the results of the Partnership\xe2\x80\x99s refinancing and maturity extension efforts.\n\xc2\xa0\nExchange of 2021 Senior Notes for New Notes and Warrants and Redemption of 2021 Senior Notes\n\xc2\xa0\nThe Partnership exchanged $599.8 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Senior Notes and the accrued and unpaid interest thereon for the following consideration: \n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n(i) $349.1 million in aggregate principal of Senior Secured Second Lien PIK Notes due 2021 (the \xe2\x80\x9cSecond Lien Notes\xe2\x80\x9d); \n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n(ii) $299.9 million in aggregate principal of Senior Secured Second Lien Exchangeable PIK Notes due 2017 (the \xe2\x80\x9cExchangeable PIK Notes,\xe2\x80\x9d and, together with the Second Lien Notes, the \xe2\x80\x9cNew Notes\xe2\x80\x9d); and \n\n59\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n(iii) 516,825 warrants (the \xe2\x80\x9cWarrants\xe2\x80\x9d) to acquire newly issued common units of FELP (the \xe2\x80\x9cCommon Units\xe2\x80\x9d) equal to 4.5% of the total limited partner units of FELP outstanding on the date of a Note Redemption (as defined below) (after \ngiving effect to the full exercise thereof and the Note Redemption). \n\xc2\xa0\n\n\nOn the Closing Date, we also redeemed the remaining $175,000 in aggregate principal amount of 2021 Senior Notes that were not exchanged. Upon such redemption, the obligations under the 2021 Senior Notes were satisfied and discharged. \n\xc2\xa0\nThe Warrants were determined to meet the accounting criteria of a detachable freestanding derivative liability instrument and the fair value of the Warrants on the Closing Date was calculated to be $34.0 million. See Part II. \xe2\x80\x9cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\xe2\x80\x93 Note 17. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\xe2\x80\x9d for additional discussion on the fair value of the Warrants. A liability for the fair value of the Warrant was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of the Closing Date and the offset was recognized as a debt discount to the New Notes. The discount was allocated pro rata between the Second Lien Notes and the Exchangeable PIK Notes in proportion to the relative fair value of each instrument held by a person other than the Reserves Investor Group (See Part II. \xe2\x80\x9cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\xe2\x80\x93 Note 15. Related-Party Transactions\xe2\x80\x9d) on the Closing Date (only the unaffiliated holders of the New Notes received the Warrants on the Closing Date). The $25.0\xc2\xa0million discount allocated to the Second Lien Notes and the $9.0 million discount allocated to the Exchangeable PIK Notes will be amortized using the effective interest method over their respective maturities.\n\xc2\xa0\nTerms of the New Notes \n\xc2\xa0\nThe Second Lien Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture and have a maturity date of August\xc2\xa015, 2021. The Second Lien Notes bear interest at a rate of: (i)\xc2\xa09.0%\xc2\xa0per annum until August\xc2\xa015, 2018 and 10.0%\xc2\xa0per annum thereafter, in each case, payable in cash on each interest payment date; and (ii)\xc2\xa01.0%\xc2\xa0per annum payable in kind. Interest is payable semi-annually on February\xc2\xa015th and August\xc2\xa015th. We may redeem the Second Lien Notes in whole or in part subject to the redemption premiums and provisions in the indenture.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nThe Exchangeable PIK Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture (the \xe2\x80\x9cExchangeable PIK Notes Indenture\xe2\x80\x9d) and have a maturity date of October\xc2\xa03,\xc2\xa02017 (the \xe2\x80\x9cExchangeable PIK Notes Maturity Date\xe2\x80\x9d). The Exchangeable PIK Notes bear interest payable in kind at a rate of 15.0%\xc2\xa0per annum, payable on March\xc2\xa01, 2017 and October\xc2\xa03, 2017. \n\xc2\xa0\nWe may redeem, repurchase, refinance, defease or otherwise retire (any of the foregoing, a \xe2\x80\x9credemption\xe2\x80\x9d) all of the Exchangeable PIK Notes on or prior to October\xc2\xa02, 2017 for cash at 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest (any such redemption, an \xe2\x80\x9cExchangeable PIK Note Retirement\xe2\x80\x9d). In addition to the Exchangeable PIK Note Retirement, the Murray Group shall have the right to purchase all (but not less than all) of the Exchangeable PIK Notes on or prior to October\xc2\xa02, 2017 for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Exchangeable PIK Notes plus accrued interest (a \xe2\x80\x9cMurray Purchase,\xe2\x80\x9d and together with an Exchangeable PIK Note Retirement and any repayment of the Exchangeable PIK Notes in full in cash that occurs on the Exchangeable PIK Notes Maturity Date, a \xe2\x80\x9cNote Redemption\xe2\x80\x9d). Upon a Murray Purchase, the Murray Group will receive FELP units equal to the principal and interest settlement amount multiplied by the lesser of: (a) a number equal to one divided by 92.5% of the last thirty days weighted-average trading price or (b) 1.12007 common units per $1.00 principal amount of Exchangeable PIK Notes. The Partnership and Murray Energy may each purchase less than all of the outstanding Exchangeable PIK Notes, so long as the combination results in redemption of all of the Exchangeable PIK Notes. The Exchangeable PIK Note Retirement may be funded with the proceeds from an investment by the Murray Group or any member thereof in FELP, from general working capital or from any other source permitted by the indenture governing the Exchangeable PIK Notes (and subject to compliance with the Partnership\xe2\x80\x99s other debt agreements). If the Exchangeable PIK Notes have not been redeemed or purchased for cash at 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest by the Exchangeable PIK Notes Maturity Date, then all outstanding Exchangeable PIK Notes (including all principal, interest and other amounts outstanding thereunder) shall be exchanged for common units representing 75% of FELP\xe2\x80\x99s outstanding limited partner units on the Exchangeable PIK Notes Maturity Date, subject to adjustment on account of certain anti-dilution protections. \n\xc2\xa0\nThe obligations under the New Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of FELP\xe2\x80\x99s wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (other than Foresight Energy Finance Corporation) and on a senior unsecured basis by FELP and are or will be secured by second-priority perfected liens on substantially all of our and the subsidiary guarantors\xe2\x80\x99 existing and future assets, subject to certain exceptions. \n\xc2\xa0\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities \n\xc2\xa0\nOn the Closing Date, FELLC entered into an amendment to its senior secured credit facilities (as amended, the \xe2\x80\x9cSenior Secured Credit Facilities\xe2\x80\x9d), pursuant to which outstanding defaults under its existing credit agreement were waived and the credit agreement was amended and restated as set forth in the third amended and restated credit agreement (the \xe2\x80\x9cAmended Credit Agreement\xe2\x80\x9d). Pursuant to the Amended Credit Agreement, the $297.8 million term loan remained outstanding on the Closing Date and matures in August 2020 (the \xe2\x80\x9cTerm Loan\xe2\x80\x9d) and the commitments under our $550.0\xc2\xa0million revolving credit facility, which terminates in August 2018, were reduced to $450.0 million (the \xe2\x80\x9cRevolving Credit Facility\xe2\x80\x9d) effective December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we \n60\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\nhad $352.5 million in borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and $7.0 million in letters of credit. Outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan were $295.7 million as of December 31, 2016. In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement added an anti-hoarding provision under our Revolving Credit Facility which prohibits new borrowings if the aggregate amount of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents (taking into account certain pending applications of cash) exceeds $35.0\xc2\xa0million both before and after giving effect to such borrowing when taking into account the intended use of such loan proceeds for bona fide purposes within 60 days. Mandatory term loan prepayments are required to be made under our Term Loan based on an excess cash flow calculation, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, for the second half of fiscal year 2016 and full fiscal year 2017, sales of assets, proceeds of insurance and condemnation awards and certain incurrence of indebtedness, subject, in each case, to customary exceptions and thresholds. \n\xc2\xa0\nUnder the Amended Credit Agreement, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option: (i)\xc2\xa0LIBOR (subject to a LIBOR floor of 0%) plus an applicable margin ranging from 3.50% to 4.50%; or (ii)\xc2\xa0a base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.50% to 3.50%; in each case, determined in accordance with our consolidated net leverage ratio. Our Term Loan bears interest at a rate equal to, at our option: (i)\xc2\xa0LIBOR (subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.00%) plus 5.50%; or (ii)\xc2\xa0a base rate plus 4.50%. We are also required to pay a commitment fee of 0.50% to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility in respect of unutilized commitments thereunder and pay a fronting fee equal to 0.125%\xc2\xa0per annum of the amount available to be drawn under letters of credit. As of December 31, 2016, the weighted-average interest rate on Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan borrowings was 5.3% and 6.5%, respectively.\n\xc2\xa0\nThe obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by FELP and on a senior secured basis by our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries and are or will be secured by first-priority perfected liens on substantially all of our and the subsidiary guarantors\xe2\x80\x99 existing and future assets, subject to certain exceptions. \n\xc2\xa0\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities require that we comply on a quarterly basis with certain financial covenants, including a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 2.00:1.00 and a maximum senior secured net leverage ratio ranging from 3.50:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2016 to 2.75:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending March\xc2\xa031, 2021 and thereafter. Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities prohibit certain restricted payments, including discretionary dividends, until the later to occur of: (i)\xc2\xa0June\xc2\xa030,\xc2\xa02018 and (ii)\xc2\xa0the date on which our obligations under our Revolving Credit Facility have been paid in full, after which restricted payments can be made of up to $25.0 million per year, subject to certain adjustments and exceptions. \n\xc2\xa0\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities also require compliance with certain covenants that significantly restricts our ability to, among other things, (i)\xc2\xa0incur additional indebtedness, (ii)\xc2\xa0incur liens, (iii)\xc2\xa0pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments, investments or acquisitions, (iv)\xc2\xa0enter into certain transactions with affiliates, (v)\xc2\xa0merge or consolidate with another person, (vi)\xc2\xa0sell, assign, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, and (vii)\xc2\xa0make voluntary prepayments of certain debt, in each case subject to exceptions.\n\xc2\xa0\nTrade A/R Securitization Program\n\xc2\xa0\nIn January 2015, Foresight Energy LP and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, entered into a $70 million receivables securitization program (the \xe2\x80\x9cSecuritization Program\xe2\x80\x9d). Under this Securitization Program, our subsidiaries sell all of their customer trade receivables (the \xe2\x80\x9cReceivables\xe2\x80\x9d), on a revolving basis, to Foresight Receivables LLC, a wholly-owned and consolidated special purpose subsidiary of Foresight Energy LP (the \xe2\x80\x9cSPV\xe2\x80\x9d). The SPV then pledges its interests in the Receivables to the securitization program lenders, which make loans to the SPV. The Securitization Program has a three-year maturity which expires on January\xc2\xa012,\xc2\xa02018. The borrowings under the Securitization Program are variable-rate and also carry a commitment fee for unutilized commitments. \n\xc2\xa0\nIn August 2016, we entered into an amended and restated receivables financing agreement pursuant to which the Securitization Program was amended to permanently reduce commitments to $50.0 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had borrowings outstanding of $14.2 million under the Securitization Program.\n\xc2\xa0\nLongwall Financing Arrangements and Capital Lease Obligations \n\xc2\xa0\nIn November 2014, we entered into a sale-leaseback financing arrangement with a financial institution under which we sold a set of longwall shields and related equipment for $55.9 million and leased the shields back under three individual leases. We account for these leases as capital lease obligations since ownership of the longwall shields and related equipment transfer back to us upon the completion of the leases. Principal and interest payments are due monthly over the five-year terms of the leases. Aggregate termination payments of $2.8 million are due at the end of the lease terms. In connection with the Restructuring Transactions, we also executed waivers to cure outstanding defaults under the master lease agreements to our capital lease obligations. These waivers, among other things, ratified the existing terms of each applicable equipment financing agreement, provided the lessor with a waiver \n61\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\nfee equal to one hundred basis points of the outstanding amount due under the agreement, increased the interest rate by one percent per annum, and, with respect to certain arrangements, released the lessor from any claims that such parties may have against the lessor with respect to the lease. As of December 31, 2016, $36.3 million was outstanding under these capital lease obligations.\n\xc2\xa0\nIn March 2012, we entered into a finance agreement with a financial institution to fund the manufacturing of longwall equipment. Upon taking possession of the longwall equipment, the interim longwall finance agreement was converted into six individual capital leases with maturities of four and five years beginning on September 1, 2012. Principal and interest payments are due monthly over the terms of the leases. In connection with the Restructuring Transactions, we also executed waivers to cure outstanding defaults under the master lease agreements to our capital lease obligations. These waivers, among other things, ratified the existing terms of each applicable equipment financing agreement, provided the lessor with a waiver fee equal to one hundred basis points of the outstanding amount due under the agreement, increased the interest rate by one percent per annum, and, with respect to certain arrangements, released the lessor from any claims that such parties may have against the lessor with respect to the lease. As of December 31, 2016, $5.2 million was outstanding under these capital lease obligations.\n\xc2\xa0\nIn May\xc2\xa02010, we entered into a credit agreement with a financial institution to provide financing for longwall equipment and related parts and accessories. The financing agreement also provided for financing of loan fees and eligible interest during the construction of the longwall equipment. The financing arrangement is collateralized by the longwall equipment. Interest accrues on the note at a fixed rate per annum of 5.555% and is due semiannually in March and September until maturity. Principal is due in semiannual payments through maturity. On the Closing Date, we entered into an amendment to the 5.555% longwall financing credit agreement under which the lenders waived the existing defaults and the maturity date was accelerated by one year by increasing the last four semi-annual amortization payments. The new maturity date of the 5.555% longwall financing arrangement is September\xc2\xa02019. In addition, the senior secured leverage ratio financial maintenance covenant was amended to be consistent with the Amended Credit Agreement. The outstanding balance as of December 31, 2016 was $41.3 million.\n\xc2\xa0\nIn January\xc2\xa02010, we entered into a credit agreement with a financial institution to provide financing for longwall equipment and related parts and accessories. The financing agreement also provided for financing of the loan fees and eligible interest during the construction of the longwall equipment. The financing arrangement is collateralized by the longwall equipment. Interest accrues on the note at a fixed rate per annum of 5.78% and is due semiannually in June and December until maturity. Principal is due in semiannual payments through maturity. On the Closing Date, we entered into an amendment to the 5.78% longwall financing credit agreement under which the lenders waived the existing defaults and the maturity date was accelerated by one year by increasing the last three semi-annual amortization payments. The new maturity date of the 5.78% longwall financing arrangement is June 2019. In addition, the senior secured leverage ratio financial maintenance covenant was amended to be consistent with the Amended Credit Agreement. The outstanding balance as of December 31, 2016 was $39.2 million.\n\xc2\xa0\nSale-Leaseback Financing Arrangements - Affiliate\n\xc2\xa0\nIn 2009, Macoupin sold certain of its coal reserves and rail facility assets to WPP LLC, a subsidiary of Natural Resources Partners LP (\xe2\x80\x9cNRP\xe2\x80\x9d), and leased them back. The gross proceeds from this transaction were $143.5 million. As Macoupin has continuing involvement in the assets sold, the transaction is treated as a financing arrangement. At December 31, 2016, the outstanding balance of the sale-leaseback financing arrangement was $141.9 million and the effective interest rate was 13.7%. \n\xc2\xa0\nIn 2012, Sugar Camp sold certain rail facility assets to HOD LLC, a subsidiary of NRP, and leased them back. The gross proceeds from this transaction were $50.0 million. As Sugar Camp has continuing involvement in the assets sold, the transaction is treated as a financing arrangement. At December 31, 2016, the outstanding balance of the sale-leaseback financing arrangement was $50.0\xc2\xa0million and the effective interest rate was 13.7%. \n\xc2\xa0\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\xc2\xa0\nIn the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements, including operating leases, coal reserve leases, take-or-pay transportation obligations, indemnifications and financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit and surety bonds. Liabilities related to these arrangements are generally not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets and, except for the coal reserve leases, take-or-pay transportation obligations and operating leases, we do not expect any material impact on our cash flows, results of operations or financial condition to result from these off-balance sheet arrangements. \n\xc2\xa0\nFrom time to time, we use bank letters of credit to secure our obligations for certain contracts and other obligations. At December\xc2\xa031,\xc2\xa02016, we had $7.0 million of letters of credit outstanding. \n\xc2\xa0\nRegulatory authorities require us to provide financial assurance to secure, in whole or in part, our future reclamation projects. We had outstanding surety bonds with third parties of $83.4 million as of December 31, 2016 to secure reclamation and other performance \n62\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\ncommitments. We have posted cash collateral of $2.5 million to our surety bond provider and Foresight Reserves has provided a guarantee on $50.5 million of the surety bonds. \nContractual Obligations \nThe following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations as of December\xc2\xa031, 2016, by year: \n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nTotal\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nLess than 1 year\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n1 - 3 years\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n3 - 5 years\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nMore than 5 years\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n(In Millions)\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nLong-term debt (principal and interest)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\n\n$\n\n1,721.2\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n$\n\n470.0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n$\n\n550.4\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n$\n\n700.8\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n$\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nSale-leaseback financing arrangements (2)\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n268.3\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n21.0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n42.0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n42.0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n163.3\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nCapital lease obligations (principal and interest)\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n45.0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n17.9\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n27.1\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nOperating lease obligations\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n6.7\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n3.3\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n3.1\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n0.3\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nTake-or-pay transportation arrangements (3)\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n312.3\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n49.6\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n103.1\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n104.7\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n54.9\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nCoal reserve lease and royalty obligations (4)\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n505.2\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n59.7\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n119.3\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n86.5\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n239.7\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nUnconditional purchase obligations (5)\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n37.9\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n37.9\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nTotal (6)\n\n$\n\n2,896.6\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n$\n\n659.4\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n$\n\n845.0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n$\n\n934.3\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n$\n\n457.9\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n(1)\n\nIncludes our Exchangeable PIK Notes, Second Lien Notes, Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan, Trade A/R Securitization Program and the 5.555% and 5.78% longwall financing arrangements. The payment-in-kind interest on the Exchangeable PIK Notes and the Second Lien Notes rolls into the principal balance and gets paid as principal at maturity. The calculated cash interest expense assumes no voluntary early principal repayments and is based on the actual interest rates as of December\xc2\xa031,\xc2\xa02016. If the Exchangeable PIK Notes have not been redeemed or purchased for cash at 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest by the Exchangeable PIK Notes Maturity Date, then all outstanding Exchangeable PIK Notes (including accrued interest) shall be exchanged for Common Units representing 75% of FELP\xe2\x80\x99s outstanding limited partner units on the Exchangeable PIK Notes Maturity Date, subject to adjustment on account of certain anti-dilution protections.  \n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n(2)\n\nRepresents the minimum annual payments required under our Macoupin and Sugar Camp sale-leaseback financing arrangements. \n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n(3)\n\nIncludes our various take-or-pay arrangements associated with rail and terminal facility commitments for the delivery of coal through the initial arrangement term. \n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n(4)\n\nComprised of the future minimum cash payments due under our various coal reserve lease and royalty obligations through the initial royalty term.\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n(5)\n\nWe have open purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements are not material and typically allow for cancellation or return without penalty. The commitments in the table above relate only to committed capital purchases as of December\xc2\xa031, 2016 and committed coal purchases with Murray Energy. The contractual table above does not include our obligations under the MSA with Murray Energy, please read Part II. \xe2\x80\x9cItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 15\xe2\x80\x93Related-Party Transactions\xe2\x80\x9d for a discussion on the terms of this contractual arrangement.\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n(6)\n\nThe contractual obligation table does not include asset retirement obligations. Asset retirement obligations result primarily from statutory, rather than contractual obligations and the ultimate timing and amount of the obligations are an estimate. As of December\xc2\xa031, 2016, we have $44.9 million recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for asset retirement obligations. \n\xc2\xa0\nWe lease certain surface rights, mineral reserves, mining, transportation, and other equipment under various lease agreements with related entities under common ownership, NRP and its subsidiaries, and other independent third parties in the normal course of business. The mineral reserve leases can generally be renewed as long as the mineral reserves are being developed and mined until all economically recoverable reserves are depleted or until mining operations cease. The leases require a production royalty at the greater amount of a base amount per ton or a percent of the gross selling price of the coal. Generally, the leases contain provisions that require the payment of minimum royalties regardless of the volume of coal produced or the level of mining activity. The minimum royalties are generally recoupable against production royalties over a contractually defined period of time (generally five to ten years). Some of these agreements also require overriding royalty and/or wheelage payments. Under the terms of some mineral reserve mining leases, we are to use commercially reasonable efforts to acquire additional mineral reserves in certain properties as defined in the agreements and are responsible for the acquisition costs and the assets are to be titled to the lessor. Transportation throughput agreements generally require a per ton fee amount for coal transported and contain certain escalation clauses and/or renegotiation clauses. For certain transportation assets, we are responsible for operations, repairs, and maintenance and for keeping transportation facilities in good working order. Surface rights, mining, and other equipment leases require monthly payments based upon the specified agreements. Certain of these leases provide options for the purchase of the property at various times during the life of the lease, \n63\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\ngenerally at its then fair market value. We also lease rail cars, certain office space and equipment under leases with varying expiration dates.\n\xc2\xa0\nSee Part III. \xe2\x80\x9cItem 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence\xe2\x80\x9d for a discussion of the above leases and agreements with affiliated parties. \n\xc2\xa0\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\xc2\xa0\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Of these significant accounting policies, we believe the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity. \n\xc2\xa0\nSale-Leaseback Financing Arrangements. In 2009, Macoupin sold certain of its coal reserves to WPP LLC, an affiliate of Natural Resource Partners LP (\xe2\x80\x9cNRP\xe2\x80\x9d), and leased them back. The gross proceeds from this transaction were $143.5 million, and were used for capital expenditures relating to the rehabilitation of the Macoupin mine and for other capital items. Similarly, in 2012, Sugar\xc2\xa0Camp sold certain rail facilities to HOD LLC, an affiliate of NRP, and leased them back. The gross proceeds from this transaction were $50.0\xc2\xa0million, and were used for capital expenditures, to pay down our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. In both transactions, because we had continuing involvement in the assets sold, the transactions were treated as sale-leaseback financing arrangements. \n\xc2\xa0\nInterest is accrued on the outstanding principal amounts of the financing arrangements using an implied interest rate, which was initially determined at inception of the lease and is adjusted for changes in future expected amounts and timing of payments based on the mine plans and also, for the Macoupin sale-leaseback only, the future expected sales price of its coal. Payments are applied first against accrued interest and any excess is then applied against the outstanding principal. Revisions to the mine plans, which occur periodically as changes are made to estimates of the quantity and the timing of tons to be mined, will impact the effective interest rate. We account for such changes by adjusting in the current period, the life-to-date interest previously recorded on the sale-leaseback to reflect the new effective interest rate as if it was applied from the inception of the transaction (i.e., retroactively applied). The implied effective interest rate was 13.7% and 13.9% as of December\xc2\xa031, 2016 and 2015, respectively, on the Macoupin sale-leaseback financing arrangement and 13.7% and 13.2% for the Sugar Camp sale-leaseback financing arrangement as of December\xc2\xa031,\xc2\xa02016 and 2015, respectively. If there is a material change to the mine plans, the impact of a change in the effective interest rate to the consolidated statements of operations could be significant. \n\xc2\xa0\nPrepaid Royalties. Prepaid royalties consist of recoupable minimum royalty payments under various lease agreements. The contractual recoupment periods are generally five to ten years from the payment date. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we established a $74.6 million reserve against our contractual prepaid royalties between Colt LLC (\xe2\x80\x9cColt\xe2\x80\x9d), a subsidiary of Foresight Reserves, and our Hillsboro and Macoupin subsidiaries. We recorded the impairment charge given that our ability to recoup these minimum royalty payments within the remaining recoupment period was improbable in light of, among other factors:\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nthe remaining recoupment periods available, as a whole, on these minimum annual royalty payments and the necessary time required to obtain permits on these reserves, \n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nour ability to raise the capital necessary to develop the reserves and the necessary infrastructure was unfavorably impacted by the Restructuring Transactions, which resulted in covenants that significantly restrict our ability to incur any additional indebtedness, and\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ncurrent and forecasted market conditions, which are impacted by supply and demand dynamics, natural gas prices, weather, economic conditions and the regulatory environment.\n\xc2\xa0\nWe previously recorded aggregate impairment charges to reserve against contractual prepaid royalties between Hillsboro and WPP given the remaining time available under the five-year recoupment periods, the current idling of the mine as a result of the mine fire, and coal based on current and forecasted near-term market conditions, which are impacted by natural gas prices, weather, economic conditions and the regulatory environment.\n\xc2\xa0\nWe continually evaluate our ability to recoup prepaid royalty balances which includes, among other things, assessing mine production plans, our access to capital markets, sales commitments, current and forecasted future coal market conditions, the time necessary to obtain required permits and the remaining years available for recoupment. As of December\xc2\xa031, 2016, we had recorded on the consolidated balance sheet prepaid royalties of $16.9 million, net of reserves. \n64\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\nWarrant Liability. The Warrants were determined to meet the criteria of a detachable freestanding derivative liability instrument and a liability for the fair value of the Warrants was recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of the Closing Date and the offset was recognized as a debt discount to the New Notes. The Warrants are required to be accounted for as a liability at fair value and the fair value must be revalued at each balance sheet date until the earlier of the exercise of the Warrants, their expiration, or until any of the features requiring liability treatment expires or is modified. The resulting non-cash gain or loss on the fair value revaluation at each balance sheet date is recorded as non-operating expense in our consolidated statement of operations\n\xc2\xa0\nThe fair value of the Warrants was calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model (including the use of a binomial lattice to model the conversion and redemption scenarios for the Exchangeable PIK Notes) which is based, in part, upon unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data (Level 3), requiring the Partnership to develop its own assumptions. A stock price volatility of 70%, a dividend yield of 0% and a risk-free forward rate of 2.61% was used in the Black-Scholes pricing model. If factors change and different assumptions are used, the change in estimated fair value could be materially different. The change in the common unit price of our stock is the predominant input affecting the fair value of the Warrants. Generally, as the market price of our common unit increases, the fair value of the Warrants increases, and conversely, as the market price of our common unit decreases, the fair value of the Warrants decreases. A 10% increase in the fair value of our common units as of December 31, 2016 would have increased the fair value of the Warrants by $4.0 million. Also, to a lesser extent, a significant increase in the volatility of the market price of the Partnership's common unit, in isolation, would result in a higher fair value measurement; and a significant decrease in volatility would result in a lower fair value measurement. \n\xc2\xa0\nAsset Retirement Obligations. Our asset retirement obligations (\xe2\x80\x9cARO\xe2\x80\x9d) consist of estimated spending related to reclaiming surface land and support facilities at our mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws as required by each mining permit. Obligations are incurred at the time mine development commences or when construction begins in the case of support facilities, refuse areas and slurry ponds. \n\xc2\xa0\nThe liability is determined using discounted cash flow techniques and is reduced to its present value at the end of each period. We estimate our ARO liabilities for final reclamation and mine closure based upon detailed engineering calculations of the amount and timing of the future cash cost for a third party to perform the required work. Spending estimates are escalated for inflation, and market risk premium, and then discounted at the credit-adjusted, risk-free rate. The credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rates were 8.5%, 9.8%, and 6.6% at December\xc2\xa031, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. We record an ARO asset associated with the discounted liability for final reclamation and mine closure. Accretion on the ARO begins at the time the liability is incurred. Upon initial recognition of a liability, a corresponding amount is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The ARO asset for equipment, structures, buildings, and mine development is amortized over its expected life on a units-of-production basis. The ARO liability is then accreted to the projected spending date. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the performance of reclamation activities), the revisions to the obligation and asset are recognized at the appropriate credit-adjusted, risk-free rate. \n\xc2\xa0\nOn at least an annual basis, we review our entire reclamation liability and make necessary adjustments for permit changes as granted by state authorities, changes in the timing of reclamation activities and revisions to cost estimates, the occurrence of new liabilities from additional disturbances and productivity assumptions. Any difference between the recorded amount of the liability and the actual cost of reclamation will be recognized as a gain or loss when the obligation is settled. At December\xc2\xa031, 2016, our consolidated balance sheet reflected asset retirement obligations of $44.9\xc2\xa0million, including amounts classified as a current liability. We estimate the aggregate undiscounted cost of final mine closures, at 2016 costs, to be approximately $101.8 million as of December\xc2\xa031,\xc2\xa02016. \n\xc2\xa0\nNew Accounting Standards Issued and Not Yet Adopted \n\xc2\xa0\nIn January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\xe2\x80\x9cFASB\xe2\x80\x9d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\xe2\x80\x9cASU\xe2\x80\x9d) 2017-01, which clarifies the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. We do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\xc2\xa0\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18 which clarified the presentation requirements of restricted cash within the statement of cash flows. Under ASU 2016-18, the changes in restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents during the period should be included in the beginning and ending cash and cash equivalents balance reconciliation on the statement of cash flows. When cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents are presented in more than one line item within the statement of financial position, an entity shall calculate a total cash amount in a narrative or tabular format that agrees to the amount shown on the statement of cash flows. Details on the nature and amounts of restricted cash should also be disclosed. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. We expect this new guidance to require adjustments to the presentation of our \n65\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\nconsolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2016, we had restricted cash of $13.4 million, of which $10.7 million is included in current asset and $2.6 million is included in long-term other assets.\n\xc2\xa0\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 that introduces a new five-step revenue recognition model in which an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires disclosures sufficient to enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. In July 2015, the FASB delayed the effective date until annual and interim periods beginning after December 31, 2017. We intend to adopt ASU 2014-09 as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. While we have not yet completed our review of the impact of the new standard, we do not currently anticipate a material impact on our revenue recognition practices. We are still evaluating disclosure requirements under the new standard and we will continue to evaluate the standard as well as additional changes, modifications or interpretations which may impact our current conclusions.\n\xc2\xa0\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation \xe2\x80\x93 Stock Compensation, which was issued to simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, the classification of awards as equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross equity-based compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur and the classification on the statement of cash flows. This pronouncement is effective for reporting periods beginning after December\xc2\xa015,\xc2\xa02016. We do not expect the adoption of this update to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\xc2\xa0\nIn February 2016, the FASB updated guidance regarding the accounting for leases. This update requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on its balance sheet. The update also expands the required quantitative and qualitative disclosures surrounding leases. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier application permitted. This update will be applied using a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. We are currently evaluating the effect of this update on our consolidated financial statements.\n\xc2\xa0\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which simplifies the measurement of inventories valued under most methods. Under this new guidance, inventories valued under these methods would be valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with net realizable value defined as the estimated selling price less reasonable costs to sell the inventory. The new guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal periods starting after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-11 to have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.\n\xc2\xa0\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\xc2\xa0\nWe define market risk as the risk of economic loss as a consequence of the adverse movement of market rates and prices. We believe our principal market risks include commodity price risk, interest rate risk and credit risk, which are disclosed below. \n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nCommodity Price Risk \n\xc2\xa0\nWe have commodity price risk as a result of changes in the market value of our coal. We try to minimize this risk by entering into fixed price coal supply agreements and, from time to time, commodity hedge agreements. As of February 17, 2017, we had the following contracted minimum sales commitments for the years ending December 31, 2017 and 2018:\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nPriced\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nUnpriced (or Index Based)\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nTotal\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n(Tons, in Millions)\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n Year ending December 31, 2017\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n15.2\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n1.7\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n16.9\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n Year ending December 31, 2018\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n6.8\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n4.0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n10.8\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have 0.5 million tons economically hedged with forward coal derivative contracts tied to the API 2 coal price index to partially mitigate coal price risk through 2017. The impact of our economic hedges to fix the selling price on unpriced (or index-based) coal sales contracts and forecasted sales is not reflected in the table above. A 10% change in the API 2 index would result in a $3.7 million change in the fair value of these derivative contracts.\n\xc2\xa0\n66\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\xc2\xa0\nWe are exposed to market risk associated with interest rates due to our existing level of indebtedness. At December 31, 2016, of our $1,433.3 million in long-term debt and capital lease obligation principal outstanding, $662.4 million of outstanding borrowings have interest rates that fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates. We currently do not hedge the interest on portions of our borrowings with variable interest rates, although we may do so from time to time in order to manage risks associated with floating interest rates. A one percentage point increase in the interest rates related to variable interest borrowings would result in an annualized increase in interest expense of approximately $6.6 million. \n\xc2\xa0\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $103.7 million. Due to the short-term duration and the low risk profile of interest bearing cash accounts, we do not believe that a one percent change in interest rates would have a material impact on our interest income.\n\xc2\xa0\nCredit Risk \n\xc2\xa0\nWe have credit risk associated with our customers and counterparties in our coal sales agreements, financing arrangements and commodity hedge contracts, including with our affiliates. We have procedures in place to assist in determining the creditworthiness and credit limits for such customers and counterparties. Generally, credit is extended based on an evaluation of the customer\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition. Collateral is not generally required, unless credit cannot be established. At December 31, 2016, no allowance was recorded for uncollectible accounts receivable as all amounts were deemed collectible. \n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\n67", shape=(), dtype=string)























tf.Tensor(b'Item\xc2\xa07. Management\xc2\x92s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion of\nthe financial condition and operating results of the Company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes of the Company, which are included in this report in Item 8, and the information set forth in\nRisk Factors under Item 1A. Except as otherwise indicated, all amounts are expressed in U.S.\xc2\xa0dollars.  Overview \nUltra Petroleum Corp. is an independent exploration and production company focused on developing its long-life natural gas\nreserves in the Green River Basin of Wyoming \xc2\x97 the Pinedale and Jonah fields \xc2\x97 its oil reserves in the Uinta Basin in Utah and its natural gas reserves in the Appalachian Basin of Pennsylvania. The Company operates in one industry segment,\nnatural gas and oil exploration and development, with one geographical segment, the United States.  The\nCompany currently conducts operations exclusively in the United States. Substantially all of its oil and natural gas activities are conducted jointly with others and, accordingly, amounts presented reflect only the Company\xc2\x92s proportionate\ninterest in such activities. The Company continues to focus on improving its drilling and production results through gaining efficiencies with the use of advanced technologies, detailed technical analysis of its properties and leveraging its\nexperience into improved operational efficiencies. Inflation has not had, nor is it expected to have in the foreseeable future, a material impact on the Company\xc2\x92s results of operations. \nThe Company currently generates its revenue, earnings and cash flow primarily from the production and sales of natural\ngas and condensate from its properties in southwest Wyoming with a portion of the Company\xc2\x92s revenues coming from oil sales from its properties in the Uinta Basin in Utah, acquired in December 2013, and gas sales from wells located in the\nAppalachian Basin in Pennsylvania. Additionally, during 2014, the Company acquired contracts related to NGLs providing the opportunity to realize the benefit of the NGLs from the gas it produces beginning in 2017. The Company elected not to process\nNGLs in 2017.  The prices of oil and natural gas are critical factors to the Company\xc2\x92s business. The\nprices of oil and natural gas have historically been volatile, and this volatility could be detrimental to the Company\xc2\x92s financial performance. As a result, and from time to time, the Company tries to limit the impact of this volatility on its\nresults by entering into swap agreements and/or fixed price forward physical delivery contracts for natural gas and oil. (See Note 7).  The average price realization for the Company\xc2\x92s natural gas during 2016 was $2.31 per Mcf. During the quarter ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016, the average price realization for the Company\xc2\x92s\nnatural gas was $2.87 per Mcf. The Company did not have any open commodity derivative contracts during the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016.  The average price realization for the Company\xc2\x92s crude oil and condensate during 2016 was $38.24 per barrel. During the quarter ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016, the average price realization for the\nCompany\xc2\x92s crude oil and condensate was $45.27 per barrel.  Chapter 11 Proceedings, Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\n Chapter 11 Proceedings \nOn April\xc2\xa029, 2016 (the \xc2\x93Petition Date\xc2\x94), to restructure their respective obligations and capital\nstructures, the Company and each of its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the \xc2\x93Ultra Entities\xc2\x94 or \xc2\x93Debtors\xc2\x94) filed voluntary petitions under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the\n\xc2\x93Bankruptcy Code\xc2\x94) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the \xc2\x93Bankruptcy Court\xc2\x94). The Debtors\xc2\x92 chapter 11 cases are being jointly administered for procedural purposes under the caption In\nre Ultra \n \xc2\xa0 46 \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nPetroleum Corp., et al, Case No.\xc2\xa016-32202 (MI) (Bankr. S.D. Tex.). Information about our chapter 11 cases is available at our website\n(www.ultrapetroleum.com) and also at a website maintained by our claims agent, Epiq Systems (http://dm.epiq11.com/UPT/Docket).  We are currently operating our business as a debtor-in-possession in accordance with the applicable provisions of the\nBankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. After we filed our chapter 11 petitions, the Bankruptcy Court granted certain relief we requested enabling us to conduct our business activities in the ordinary course, including, among other\nthings and subject to the terms and conditions of such orders, authorizing us to pay employee wages and benefits, pay taxes and certain governmental fees and charges, continue to operate our cash management system in the ordinary course, remit funds\nwe hold from time to time for the benefit of third parties (such as royalty owners), and pay the prepetition claims of certain of our vendors that hold liens under applicable non-bankruptcy law. For goods and\nservices provided following the Petition Date, we intend to pay vendors in full under normal terms.  Subject\nto certain exceptions provided for in section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code, all judicial and administrative proceedings against us or our property were automatically enjoined, or stayed, as of the Petition Date. In addition, the filing of new judicial\nor administrative actions against us or our property for claims arising prior to the date on which our chapter 11 cases were filed were automatically enjoined. This prohibits, for example, our lenders or noteholders from pursuing claims for defaults\nunder our debt agreements and our contract counterparties from pursuing claims for defaults under our contracts. Accordingly, unless the Bankruptcy Court agrees to lift the automatic stay, all of our prepetition liabilities and obligations should be\nsettled or compromised under the Bankruptcy Code as part of our chapter 11 proceedings.  Our operations and\nability to execute our business remain subject to the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A, \xc2\x93Risk Factors\xc2\x94. In addition, our assets, liabilities, including our capital structure, shareholders, officers and/or directors could change\nmaterially because of our chapter 11 cases. In addition, the description of our operations, properties and capital plans included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may not accurately reflect our operations,\nproperties and capital plans after we emerge from chapter 11.  Creditors\xc2\x92 Committees \xc2\x97 Appointment\xc2\xa0&\nFormation  On May\xc2\xa05, 2016, the United States Trustee for the Southern District of Texas appointed\nan official committee for unsecured creditors of all of the Debtors (the \xc2\x93UCC\xc2\x94). On September\xc2\xa026, 2016, the United States Trustee for the Southern District of Texas filed a Notice of Reconstitution of the UCC. In addition, certain\nother stakeholders have organized for purposes of participating in the Debtors\xc2\x92 chapter 11 cases: (i)\xc2\xa0on June\xc2\xa08, 2016, an informal ad hoc committee of unsecured creditors of our subsidiary, Ultra Resources (\xc2\x93Ultra\nResources\xc2\x94), notified the Bankruptcy Court it had formed and identified its members, most of which are distressed debt investors and/or hedge funds; (ii)\xc2\xa0on June\xc2\xa013, 2016, an informal ad hoc committee of the holders of senior notes\nissued by the Company notified the Bankruptcy Court it had formed and identified its members; (iii)\xc2\xa0on July\xc2\xa020, 2016, an informal ad hoc committee of shareholders of the Company notified the Bankruptcy Court it had formed and identified\nits members; and (iv)\xc2\xa0on January\xc2\xa06, 2017, an informal ad hoc committee of unsecured creditors of our subsidiary, Ultra Resources, notified the Bankruptcy Court it had formed and identified its members, most of which are insurance\ncompanies. We expect each of the committees to be involved in our chapter 11 cases, and any disagreements with any of the committees may extend our chapter 11 cases, increase the cost of our chapter 11 cases, and/or delay our emergence from chapter\n11.  Exclusivity  The Bankruptcy Code provides chapter 11 debtors-in-possession with the exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization\nunder chapter 11 through a period of time specified in the Bankruptcy Code, which period may be extended by the Bankruptcy Court. On July\xc2\xa027, 2016, we filed a motion seeking an extension of the exclusive chapter 11 plan filing period. At a\nhearing conducted on August\xc2\xa025, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court extended our \n \xc2\xa0 47 \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nexclusive right to file a plan of reorganization under chapter 11 through and including March\xc2\xa01, 2017, and to solicit acceptances of such plan through and including May\xc2\xa01, 2017, subject\nto our producing and delivering a long-term business plan prior to December\xc2\xa01, 2016. The long-term business plan was provided prior to December\xc2\xa01, 2016, and, pursuant to a Stipulation Regarding Order Extending Exclusivity signed by the\nBankruptcy Court, we satisfied the condition (with the effect that our exclusive right to file a reorganization plan now continues until and including March\xc2\xa01, 2017, and our exclusive right to solicit acceptances of such a plan continues until\nand including May\xc2\xa01, 2017). On February\xc2\xa01, 2017, we filed a motion seeking an extension of the exclusive chapter 11 plan filing period through June\xc2\xa029, 2017 and the exclusive right to solicit acceptances of a chapter 11 plan through\nAugust\xc2\xa029, 2017. On February\xc2\xa017, 2017, we filed a revised proposed form of order to the motion seeking an extension of the exclusive chapter 11 plan filing period through April\xc2\xa015, 2017 and the exclusive right to solicit acceptances\nof a chapter 11 plan through June\xc2\xa015, 2017.  Plan Support Agreement, Rights Offering, Backstop Commitment Agreement\nand Exit Financing Commitment Letter  On November\xc2\xa021, 2016, each of the Ultra Entities entered\ninto a Plan Support Agreement (\xc2\x93PSA\xc2\x94) with (i)\xc2\xa0holders of at least 66.67% of the principal amount of the Company\xc2\x92s outstanding 5.750% Senior Notes due 2018 and 6.125% Senior Notes due 2024 and (ii)\xc2\xa0shareholders who own at\nleast a majority of the Company\xc2\x92s outstanding common stock or the economic interests therein (collectively, the \xc2\x93Plan Support Parties\xc2\x94) and a Backstop Commitment Agreement (\xc2\x93BCA\xc2\x94) with a subset thereof (collectively, the\n\xc2\x93Commitment Parties\xc2\x94).  Plan Support Agreement:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The PSA sets\nforth the terms and conditions pursuant to which the Ultra Entities and the Commitment Parties have agreed to seek and support a joint plan of reorganization at an aggregate plan value of $6.25\xc2\xa0billion, $6.0\xc2\xa0billion, or $5.5\xc2\xa0billion,\ndepending on commodity prices, for the Ultra Entities which will successfully complete the Reorganization Proceedings (collectively, the \xc2\x93Plan\xc2\x94). Under the Plan, the total enterprise value of the Ultra Entities will be $6.0\xc2\xa0billion\n(the \xc2\x93Plan Value\xc2\x94); provided, that if the average closing price of the 12-month forward Henry Hub natural gas strip price during the seven (7)\xc2\xa0trading days preceding the commencement of the\nRights Offering solicitation is: (i)\xc2\xa0greater than $3.65/MMBtu, the Plan Value will be $6.25\xc2\xa0billion; or (ii)\xc2\xa0less than $3.25/MMBtu, the Plan Value will be $5.5\xc2\xa0billion. \nAmong other matters, the Plan provides for a comprehensive restructuring of all allowable claims against and interests in\nthe Ultra Entities, including the conversion of the outstanding unsecured senior notes issued by the Company (\xc2\x93HoldCo Notes\xc2\x94 and, the holders thereof, \xc2\x93HoldCo Noteholders\xc2\x94) to newly-issued shares of common stock in the Company,\nthe exchange of the outstanding unsecured senior notes issued by UPL\xc2\x92s subsidiary Ultra Resources for a combination of new unsecured notes issued by Ultra Resources and cash, the payment in full of all other allowed claims against the Ultra\nDebtors in cash, and the distribution to each owner of common stock in the Company as of the Plan\xc2\x92s record date (\xc2\x93HoldCo Equityholders\xc2\x94) of such owner\xc2\x92s pro rata share of the new UPL common stock and the right to participate in\nthe Rights Offering (as described below).  The PSA provides certain milestones for the restructuring, which\nthe Company is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy. Failure of the Company to satisfy certain milestones, including (i)\xc2\xa0entry of an order approving the Debtors\xc2\x92 entry into the BCA by January\xc2\xa020, 2017 and\n(ii)\xc2\xa0consummation of the Plan by April\xc2\xa015, 2017 would provide the Plan Support Parties a termination right under the PSA.  On February\xc2\xa09, 2017, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the Plan Support Agreement (the \xc2\x93PSA Amendment\xc2\x94) with the Plan Support Parties party thereto. Pursuant to the PSA\nAmendment, the Required Consenting Parties agreed that the Plan Term Sheet, as modified to accord with the treatment of OpCo Funded Debt Claims and General Unsecured Claims under the Second Amended Plan, is reasonably satisfactory to such parties\n(as such terms are defined in the Plan Support Agreement).  On February\xc2\xa013, 2017, the Court signed an\norder approving our Disclosure Statement. On February\xc2\xa021, 2017, the Court signed an amended order approving our Disclosure Statement. The amended order: (1)\xc2\xa0approves \n \xc2\xa0 48 \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nthe adequacy of our Disclosure Statement, (2)\xc2\xa0approves the solicitation and notice procedures related to confirmation of our plan of reorganization, (3)\xc2\xa0approves the forms of ballots\nand notices related thereto, (4)\xc2\xa0approves the rights offering procedures and matters related thereto, (5)\xc2\xa0schedules certain dates related to our plan confirmation process and Rights Offering, and (6)\xc2\xa0grants related relief. With\nrespect to the Rights Offering, the amended order defines the \xc2\x93Subscription Commencement Date\xc2\x94 as February\xc2\xa021, 2017. Accordingly, as will be reflected in the materials to be distributed in connection with the Rights Offering, the Plan\nValue under the PSA is $6.0\xc2\xa0billion.  Rights Offering:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In accordance\nwith the Plan, the BCA and the Rights Offering procedures submitted by the Company in connection with the Plan, the Company will offer eligible debt and equity holders, including the Commitment Parties, the right to purchase shares of new common\nstock in the Company upon effectiveness of the Plan for an aggregate purchase price of $580.0\xc2\xa0million. The Rights Offering will consist of the following offerings:  \xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\x95\n\xc2\xa0\n HoldCo Noteholders shall be granted rights (the \xc2\x93HoldCo Noteholder Rights Offering\xc2\x94) entitling each such holder to subscribe for the\nRights Offering in an amount up to its pro rata share of new common stock (the \xc2\x93HoldCo Noteholder Rights Offering Shares\xc2\x94), which HoldCo Noteholder Rights Offering Shares, collectively, will reflect an aggregate purchase price of\n$435.0\xc2\xa0million.  \xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\x95\n\xc2\xa0\n HoldCo Equityholders shall be granted rights (the \xc2\x93HoldCo Equityholder Rights Offering\xc2\x94) entitling each such holder to subscribe for the\nRights Offering in an amount up to its pro rata share of new common stock (the \xc2\x93HoldCo Equityholder Rights Offering Shares\xc2\x94 and, together with the HoldCo Noteholder Rights Offering Shares, the \xc2\x93Rights Offering Shares\xc2\x94), which\nHoldCo Equityholder Rights Offering Shares, collectively, will reflect an aggregate purchase price of $145.0\xc2\xa0million.  Backstop Commitment Agreement:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the BCA, the Commitment Parties have agreed to purchase the HoldCo Noteholder Rights Offering Shares and the HoldCo Equityholder\nRights Offering Shares, as applicable, that are not duly subscribed for pursuant to the HoldCo Noteholder Rights Offering or the HoldCo Equityholder Rights Offering, as applicable, by parties other than Commitment Parties (the \xc2\x93Backstop\nCommitment\xc2\x94) at an implied 20% discount to the Plan Value, which is the price for the rights offering set forth in the PSA (the \xc2\x93Rights Offering Price\xc2\x94). \nThe Company will pay the Commitment Parties upon the closing of the Rights Offering a Commitment Premium equal to 6.0% of\nthe $580.0\xc2\xa0million committed amount (the \xc2\x93Commitment Premium\xc2\x94). The Commitment Premium was fully earned as of January\xc2\xa019, 2017, the date the Backstop Approval Order was entered by the Bankruptcy Court. The Commitment Premium will\nbe paid either in the form of new common stock at the Rights Offering Price, if the Plan is consummated as contemplated in the Plan Support Agreement, or in cash in the amount of 4.0% of the $580.0\xc2\xa0million committed amount, if the Backstop\nAgreement is terminated other than as a result of a material breach by the Commitment Parties.  Exit\nFinancing Commitment Letter:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On February\xc2\xa08, 2017, the Debtors obtained a commitment letter (the \xc2\x93Commitment Letter\xc2\x94) from Barclays Bank PLC (including any affiliates that may perform its responsibilities\nthereunder, \xc2\x93Barclays\xc2\x94), pursuant to which, in connection with the consummation of the Plan, Barclays has agreed to provide secured and unsecured financing in an aggregate amount of up to $2.4\xc2\xa0billion, consisting of: \n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\x95\n\xc2\xa0\n A seven-year senior secured first lien term loan credit facility (the \xc2\x93Term Loan Facility\xc2\x94) in an aggregate amount of $600.0\xc2\xa0million;\n \xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\x95\n\xc2\xa0\n A five-year senior secured first lien revolving credit facility (the \xc2\x93Revolving Facility\xc2\x94) in an aggregate amount of $400.0\xc2\xa0million\nwith an initial borrowing base (the \xc2\x93Borrowing Base\xc2\x94) (which limits the aggregate amount of first lien debt under the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan Facility) of $1.0\xc2\xa0billion with scheduled semi-annual redeterminations starting\non October\xc2\xa01, 2017; and  \xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\x95\n\xc2\xa0\n Senior unsecured bridge loans under senior unsecured bridge facilities (together with the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan Facility, the\n\xc2\x93Credit Facilities\xc2\x94) in an aggregate amount of $1.4\xc2\xa0billion, \n \xc2\xa0 49 \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n \nconsisting of (i)\xc2\xa0a five-year bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of $700.0\xc2\xa0million, less the aggregate principal amount of privately placed five-year senior unsecured\nnotes of the Company, if any, issued on or prior to the closing date of the Credit Facilities (the \xc2\x93Closing Date\xc2\x94) and (ii)\xc2\xa0an eight-year bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of $700.0\xc2\xa0million, less the aggregate\nprincipal amount of privately placed eight-year senior unsecured notes of the Company, if any, issued on or prior to the Closing Date.  The Revolving Facility is anticipated to, among other things:  \xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\x95\n\xc2\xa0\n have capacity for the Debtors to increase the commitments subject to certain conditions; \n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\x95\n\xc2\xa0\n have $100.0\xc2\xa0million of the commitments available for the issuance of letters of credit; and \n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\x95\n\xc2\xa0\n require the Company to maintain (A)\xc2\xa0a maximum total net debt to EBITDAX ratio of (i) 4.25 to 1.0 as of the end of the first full fiscal quarter\nafter the closing date and each subsequent fiscal quarter of 2017 and (ii) 4.0 to 1.0 as of the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter, (B)\xc2\xa0a minimum current ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 and (C)\xc2\xa0a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.5 to 1.0.\n The Term Loan Facility is anticipated to, among other things, have capacity for the Debtors\nto increase the commitments, with such increase in commitments subject to certain conditions.  The Revolving\nFacility and Term Loan Facility will include customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, as to compliance with laws, delivery of quarterly and annual financial statements and oil and gas engineering reports,\nmaintenance and operation of properties (including oil and gas properties), maintenance of a lien on, and delivery of title information with respect to, 85% of the Debtors\xc2\x92 proved oil and gas reserves, restrictions on the incurrence of liens,\nindebtedness, asset dispositions, fundamental changes, restricted payments and other customary covenants.  The\nRevolving Facility and Term Loan Facility will include events of default relating to customary matters, including, among other things, nonpayment of principal, interest or other amounts; violation of covenants; incorrectness of representations and\nwarranties in any material respect; cross-payment default and cross acceleration with respect to material indebtedness; bankruptcy; material judgments; and certain ERISA events. Many events of default are subject to customary notice and cure\nperiods.  The commitments of Barclays to provide the Credit Facilities are subject to certain conditions set\nforth in the Commitment Letter, including but not limited to the Plan Support Parties\xc2\x92 reasonable satisfaction with the approval by the Bankruptcy Court of all actions to be taken, undertakings to be made and obligations to be incurred by the\nDebtors in connection with the Credit Facilities.  The Commitment Letter will terminate upon the occurrence of\ncertain events described therein and the outside termination date for the Commitment Letter is May\xc2\xa09, 2017.  Based on the indicative pricing levels provided to the Company, the blended interest rate of the Credit Facilities on the effective date of the Plan (the \xc2\x93Blended Rate\xc2\x94) is expected to be\napproximately 5.10% per annum. The actual Blended Rate on the effective date of the Plan will depend on factors including, without limitation, the size of each tranche of the Credit Facilities and the results of the syndication process of such\nCredit Facilities, and may therefore be higher or lower than 5.10% per annum.  As previously disclosed on a\nCurrent Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February\xc2\xa09, 2017, on February\xc2\xa08, 2017, the Debtors filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking authorization to enter into and perform under the\nCommitment Letter and the other commitment papers. The motion was heard and approved during the Company\xc2\x92s disclosure statement hearing on February\xc2\xa013, 2017. \n \xc2\xa0 50 \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n Plan of Reorganization (Disclosure Statement) \nWe plan to emerge from our chapter 11 cases after we obtain approval from the Bankruptcy Court for a chapter 11 plan of\nreorganization. Among other things, a chapter 11 plan of reorganization will determine the rights and satisfy the claims of our prepetition creditors and security holders. The terms and conditions of a chapter 11 plan of reorganization will be\ndetermined through negotiations with our stakeholders and, possibly, decisions by the Bankruptcy Court.  On\nDecember\xc2\xa06, 2016, we filed an initial plan of reorganization and disclosure statement therefore. On January\xc2\xa017, 2017, we filed a revised plan of reorganization and disclosure statement therefore. On February\xc2\xa08, 2017, we filed a\nfurther revised plan of reorganization and disclosure statement therefore. On February\xc2\xa013, 2017, we filed amendments and further revisions to the plan of reorganization we filed on February\xc2\xa08, 2017 (the \xc2\x93Plan\xc2\x94) and to the\ndisclosure statement therefore (the \xc2\x93Disclosure Statement\xc2\x94). The Court approved our Disclosure Statement on February\xc2\xa013, 2017 and scheduled a hearing to consider confirmation of the Plan for March\xc2\xa014, 2017. \nUnder the absolute priority scheme established by the Bankruptcy Code, unless our creditors agree otherwise, all of our\nprepetition liabilities and postpetition liabilities must be satisfied in full before the holders of our existing common stock can receive any distribution or retain any property under a chapter 11 plan of reorganization. The ultimate recovery to\ncreditors and/or shareholders, if any, will not be determined until confirmation and implementation of a plan or plans of reorganization. We can give no assurance that any recovery or distribution of any amount will be made to any of our creditors\nor shareholders. Our plan of reorganization could result in any of the holders of our liabilities and/or securities, including our common stock, receiving no distribution on account of their interests and cancellation of their holdings. Moreover, a\nplan of reorganization can be confirmed, under the Bankruptcy Code, even if the holders of our common stock vote against the plan and even if the plan provides that the holders of our common stock receive no distribution on account of their equity\ninterests.  Liabilities Subject to Compromise \nWe have applied Accounting Standards Codification (\xc2\x93ASC\xc2\x94) 852, Reorganizations, in preparing the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, the consolidated financial statements presented here include amounts classified as \xc2\x93liabilities subject to compromise.\xc2\x94\nThis amount represents estimates of known or potential prepetition claims expected to be resolved in connection with our chapter 11 proceedings. Additional amounts may be included in liabilities subject to compromise in future periods if we elect to\nreject executory contracts and unexpired leases as part of our chapter 11 cases. Due to the uncertain nature of many of the potential claims, the magnitude of potential claims is not reasonably estimable at this time. Potential claims not currently\nincluded with liabilities subject to compromise in our Consolidated Balance Sheets may be material. In addition, differences between amounts we are reporting as liabilities subject to compromise in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the amounts attributable to such matters claimed by our creditors or approved by the Bankruptcy Court may be material. We will continue to evaluate our liabilities throughout the chapter 11 process, and we\nplan to make adjustments in future periods as necessary and appropriate. Such adjustments may be material. \nUnder the Bankruptcy Code, we may assume, assign, or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases, subject to\nthe approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions. If we reject a contract or lease, such rejection generally (1)\xc2\xa0is treated as a prepetition breach of the contract or lease, (2)\xc2\xa0subject to certain exceptions, relieves the\nDebtors of performing their future obligations under such contract or lease, and (3)\xc2\xa0entitles the counterparty thereto to a prepetition general unsecured claim for damages caused by such deemed breach. If we assume an executory contract or\nunexpired lease, we are generally required to cure any existing monetary defaults under such contract or lease and provide adequate assurance of future performance to the counterparty. Accordingly, any description of an executory contract or\nunexpired lease in this Annual Report on \n \xc2\xa0 51 \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nForm 10-K, including any quantification of our obligations under any such contract or lease, is wholly qualified by the rejection rights we have under the\nBankruptcy Code. Further, nothing herein is or shall be deemed an admission with respect to any claim amounts or calculations arising from the rejection of any executory contract or unexpired lease and we expressly preserve all of our rights with\nrespect thereto.

On\nOctober\xc2\xa014, 2016, Ultra Wyoming LGS, LLC (\xc2\x93UWLGS\xc2\x94), one of the Debtors and our indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, filed an amendment to its Schedules and Statements. The Schedules and Statements are subject to further amendment or\nmodification. Certain holders of prepetition claims were required to file proofs of claim by the deadline for filing certain proofs of claims in the Debtors\xc2\x92 chapter 11 cases, which deadline was September\xc2\xa01, 2016, for prepetition general\nunsecured claims and October\xc2\xa026, 2016, for governmental claims. Differences between amounts scheduled by the Debtors and claims by creditors will be investigated and resolved in connection with the claims resolution process. In light of the\nexpected number of creditors, the claims resolution process may take considerable time to complete and will likely continue after our emergence from bankruptcy. Accordingly, the ultimate number and amount of allowed claims is not presently known,\nnor can the ultimate recovery with respect to allowed claims be presently ascertained.  To the best of our\nknowledge, we have notified all of our known current or potential creditors that the Debtors have filed chapter 11 cases. The Schedules and Statements set forth, among other things, the assets and liabilities of each of the Debtors, including\nexecutory contracts to which each of the Debtors is a party, and are subject to the qualifications and assumptions included therein and amendment or modification as our chapter 11 cases proceed. \nThrough the claims resolution process, differences in amounts scheduled by the Debtors and claims filed by creditors will\nbe investigated and resolved, including through the filing of objections with the Bankruptcy Court where appropriate.  Many of the claims identified in the Schedules and Statements are listed as disputed, contingent or unliquidated. In addition, there are differences between the amounts for certain claims listed in the\nSchedules and Statements and the amounts claimed by our creditors. Such differences, as well as other disputes and contingencies will be investigated and resolved as part of our claims resolution process in our chapter 11 cases. Please refer to Note\n11 for additional information about contingent matters and commitments related to certain claims filed in our chapter 11 cases.  Pursuant to the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, some creditors who wished to assert prepetition claims against us and whose claims (i)\xc2\xa0were not listed in the Schedules and Statements or\n(ii)\xc2\xa0were listed in the \n \xc2\xa0 52 \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nSchedules and Statements as disputed, contingent, or unliquidated, were required to file a proof of claim with the Bankruptcy Court prior to the bar date set by the court. The bar date for non-governmental creditors was September\xc2\xa01, 2016, and the bar date for governmental creditors was October\xc2\xa026, 2016.  The claims filed against the Debtors to date are voluminous. Further, it is possible that claimants will file amended or modified claims in the future, including modifications or amendments to assign\nvalues to claims originally filed with no designated value. The amended or modified claims may be material. \nWe plan to investigate and evaluate all filed claims in connection with our plan of reorganization. As a part of the\nclaims resolution process, we anticipate working to resolve differences in amounts we listed in our Schedules and Statements and amounts of claims filed by our creditors. We have already identified, for example, claims that we believe should be\ndisallowed by the Bankruptcy Court because they are duplicative, have been later amended or superseded, are without merit, are overstated or for other reasons. We have previously filed, and we will continue to file and prosecute, objections with the\nBankruptcy Court as necessary for claims we believe should be disallowed.  Tax Attributes; Net Operating Loss\nCarryforwards  We have substantial tax net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. Under\nthe U.S. Internal Revenue Code, our ability to use these net operating losses and other tax attributes may be limited if we experience a change of control, as determined under U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, we obtained an order from the\nBankruptcy Court that is intended to protect our ability to use our tax attributes by imposing certain notice procedures and transfer restrictions on the trading of the Company\xc2\x92s common stock. \nIn general, the order applies to any person or entity that, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns (or would\nbeneficially own as a result of a proposed transfer) at least 4.5% of the Company\xc2\x92s common stock. Such persons are required to notify us and the Bankruptcy Court before effecting a transaction that might result in us losing the ability to use\nour tax attributes, and we have the right to seek an injunction to prevent the transaction if it might adversely affect our ability to use our tax attributes.  Any purchase, sale or other transfer of our equity securities in violation of the restrictions of the order is null and would be treated as invalid from the outset as an act in violation of a Bankruptcy\nCourt order and would therefore confer no rights on a proposed transferee.  Costs of Reorganization \nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs associated with our reorganization and the chapter 11\nproceedings. We expect these costs, which are being expensed as incurred, will significantly affect our results of operations. In addition, a non-cash charge to\nwrite-off the unamortized debt issuance costs related to our funded indebtedness is included in \xc2\x93Reorganization items, net\xc2\x94 as these debt instruments are expected to be impacted by the pendency of\nthe Company\xc2\x92s chapter 11 cases.

The Consolidated Financial Statements do\nnot reflect any adjustments that might result from the outcome of our chapter 11 proceedings. We have significant indebtedness, all of which we have reclassified to liabilities subject to compromise at December\xc2\xa031, 2016. Our level of\nindebtedness has adversely impacted and is continuing to adversely impact our financial condition. As a result of our financial condition, the defaults under our debt agreements, and the risks and uncertainties surrounding our chapter 11\nproceedings, substantial doubt exists that we will be able to continue as a going concern.  Critical Accounting Policies \nThe discussion and analysis of the Company\xc2\x92s financial condition and results of operations is based upon consolidated\nfinancial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S.\xc2\xa0GAAP. In addition, application of GAAP requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of\nthe financial statements as well as the revenues and expenses reported during the period. Changes in these estimates related to judgments and assumptions will occur as a result of future events, and, accordingly, actual results could differ from\namounts estimated. Set forth below is a discussion of the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements which we believe involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. \nOil and Gas Reserves.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The reserve estimates presented herein were made in accordance\nwith oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure authoritative accounting guidance according to Financial Accounting Standards Board (\xc2\x93FASB\xc2\x94) Accounting Standards Codification (\xc2\x93ASC\xc2\x94) Topic 932, Extractive Activities \xc2\x97 Oil\nand Gas (\xc2\x93FASB ASC 932\xc2\x94) as updated in order to align the reserve calculation and disclosure requirements with those in SEC Release No.\xc2\xa033-8995. \n \xc2\xa0 54 \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n The Company utilizes reliable technology such as seismic data and\ninterpretation, wireline formation tests, geophysical logs and core data to assess its resources. However, none of these technologies have contributed to a material addition to the proved reserves in this report. \nEstimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves significantly affect the Company\xc2\x92s depreciation, depletion\nand amortization (\xc2\x93DD&A\xc2\x94) expense. For example, if estimates of proved reserves decline, the Company\xc2\x92s DD&A rate will increase, resulting in a decrease in net income. A decline in estimates of proved reserves may result from a\nnumber of factors including lower prices, evaluation of additional operating history, mechanical problems on our wells and catastrophic events. Lower prices also make it uneconomical to drill wells or produce from fields with high operating costs.\n The Company\xc2\x92s proved reserves are a function of many assumptions, all of which could deviate materially\nfrom actual results. As a result, the estimates of proved reserves could vary over time, and could vary from actual results.  Full Cost Method of Accounting.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for exploration and development activities as defined by the Securities and\nExchange Commission (\xc2\x93SEC\xc2\x94) Release No.\xc2\xa033-8995, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Requirements (\xc2\x93SEC Release No.\xc2\xa033-8995\xc2\x94) and\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (\xc2\x93FASB\xc2\x94) Accounting Standards Codification (\xc2\x93ASC\xc2\x94) Topic 932, Extractive Additives \xc2\x97 Oil and Gas (\xc2\x93FASB ASC 932\xc2\x94). Under this method of accounting, the costs of unsuccessful, as\nwell as successful, exploration and development activities are capitalized as oil and gas properties. This includes any internal costs that are directly related to exploration and development activities but does not include any costs related to\nproduction, general corporate overhead or similar activities. The carrying amount of oil and natural gas properties also includes estimated asset retirement costs recorded on the fair value of the asset retirement obligation when incurred. Gain or\nloss or other disposition of oil and natural gas properties is not recognized, unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country.\n The sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development costs of oil and natural gas properties are\namortized using the units-of-production method based on the Company\xc2\x92s proved reserves. Oil and natural gas reserves and production are converted into equivalent\nunits based on relative energy content. Asset retirement costs are included in the base costs for calculating depletion.  Under the full cost method, costs of unevaluated properties and major development projects expected to require significant future costs may be excluded from capitalized costs being amortized. The Company\nexcludes significant costs until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired. The Company reviews its unproved leasehold costs quarterly or when management determines that events or circumstances indicate that the\nrecorded carrying value of the unevaluated properties may not be recoverable. The fair values of unproved properties are evaluated utilizing a discounted net cash flows model based on management\xc2\x92s assumptions of future oil and gas production,\ncommodity prices, operating and development costs; as well as appropriate discount rates. The estimated prices used in the cash flow analysis are determined by management based on forward price curves for the related commodities, adjusted for\naverage historical location and quality differentials. Estimates of cash flows related to probable and possible reserves are reduced by additional risk weighting factors. The amount of any impairment is transferred to the capitalized costs being\namortized.  Write-down of Oil and Gas\nProperties.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test calculation each quarter. The\nfull cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by SEC Regulation\xc2\xa0S-X Rule\xc2\xa04-10. The ceiling test is performed quarterly, on a country-by-country basis, utilizing the average of prices in effect on the first day of the month for the preceding twelve month period in accordance with SEC Release No.\xc2\xa033-8995. The ceiling limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved crude oil and natural gas reserves discounted at 10%, plus the lower of cost\nor market value of unproved properties, less any \n \xc2\xa0 55 \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nassociated tax effects. If such capitalized costs exceed the ceiling, the Company will record a write-down to the extent of such excess as a non-cash\ncharge to earnings. Any such write-down will reduce earnings in the period of occurrence and results in a lower depletion, depreciation and amortization (\xc2\x93DD&A\xc2\x94) rate in future periods. A write-down may not be reversed in future\nperiods even though higher oil and natural gas prices may subsequently increase the ceiling.  During 2015, the\nCompany recorded a $3.1\xc2\xa0billion non-cash write-down of the carrying value of the Company\xc2\x92s proved oil and gas properties as a result of ceiling test limitations, which is reflected with ceiling test\nand other impairments in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The ceiling test was calculated based upon the average of quoted market prices in effect on the first day of the month for the preceding twelve month period at\nDecember\xc2\xa031, 2015 for Henry Hub natural gas and West Texas Intermediate oil, adjusted for market differentials. The Company did not have any write-downs related to the full cost ceiling limitation in 2016 or 2014. \nDeferred Financing Costs.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016, a non-cash charge to write-off all of the unamortized debt issuance costs related to the unsecured Credit Agreement, unsecured Senior Notes (as defined below) issued by Ultra\nResources, Inc., the unsecured 2018 Senior Notes (as defined below) issued by the Company and the unsecured 2024 Senior Notes (as defined below) issued by the Company is included in Reorganization items, net in the accompanying Consolidated\nStatements of Operations as these debt instruments are expected to be impacted by the pendency of the Company\xc2\x92s chapter 11 cases. At December\xc2\xa031, 2015, other current assets includes costs associated with the issuance of our revolving\ncredit facility while costs associated with the issuance of our Senior Notes, 2018 Notes and 2024 Notes are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability. \nAsset Retirement Obligation.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Company\xc2\x92s asset retirement obligations\n(\xc2\x93ARO\xc2\x94) consist primarily of estimated costs of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation and similar activities associated with its oil and natural gas properties. FASB ASC Topic 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations\n(\xc2\x93FASB ASC 410\xc2\x94) requires that the discounted fair value of a liability for an ARO be recognized in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and\nnatural gas asset. The recognition of an ARO requires that management make numerous estimates, assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an ARO, estimated probabilities, amounts and timing of\nsettlements; the credit-adjusted, risk-free rate to be used; inflation rates, and future advances in technology. In periods subsequent to initial measurement of the ARO, the Company must recognize period-to-period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows. Increases in the ARO\nliability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense. The related capitalized costs, including revisions thereto, are charged to expense through DD&A. \nEntitlements Method of Accounting for Oil and Natural Gas Sales.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Company\ngenerally sells oil and natural gas under both long-term and short-term agreements at prevailing market prices and under multi-year contracts that provide for a fixed price of oil and natural gas. The Company recognizes revenues when the oil and\nnatural gas is delivered, which occurs when the customer has taken title and has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership, prices are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company accounts for oil and natural gas\nsales using the \xc2\x93entitlements method.\xc2\x94 Under the entitlements method, revenue is recorded based upon the Company\xc2\x92s ownership share of volumes sold, regardless of whether it has taken its ownership share of such volumes. \nMake-up provisions and ultimate settlements of volume imbalances are generally\ngoverned by agreements between the Company and its partners with respect to specific properties or, in the absence of such agreements, through negotiation. The value of volumes over- or under-produced can change based on changes in commodity prices.\nThe Company prefers the entitlements method of accounting for oil and natural gas sales because it allows \n \xc2\xa0 56 \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nfor recognition of revenue based on its actual share of jointly owned production, results in better matching of revenue with related operating expenses, and provides balance sheet recognition of\nthe estimated value of product imbalances.  Valuation of Deferred Tax\nAssets.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, future income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement\ncarrying values and their respective income tax basis (temporary differences).  To assess the realization of\ndeferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable\nincome during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.\n The Company has recorded a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets of $1.3\xc2\xa0billion as of\nDecember\xc2\xa031, 2016. Some or all of this valuation allowance may be reversed in future periods against future income.  Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Company follows FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (\xc2\x93FASB ASC 815\xc2\x94). The Company records the fair\nvalue of its commodity derivatives as an asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and records the changes in the fair value of its commodity derivatives in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as an unrealized gain or loss on\ncommodity derivatives.  Fair Value Measurements.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Company follows FASB\nASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (\xc2\x93FASB ASC 820\xc2\x94). Under FASB ASC 820, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants at measurement date and establishes a three level hierarchy for measuring fair value. The valuation assumptions the Company has used to measure the fair value of its commodity derivatives were observable inputs based on market\ndata obtained from independent sources and are considered Level\xc2\xa02 inputs (quoted prices for similar assets, liabilities (adjusted) and market-corroborated inputs). See Note\xc2\xa08 for additional information. \nLegal, Environmental and Other Contingencies.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A provision for legal, environmental\nand other contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is a complex estimation\nprocess that includes the subjective judgment of management. In many cases, management\xc2\x92s judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and/or courts of law. The Company\xc2\x92s\nmanagement closely monitors known and potential legal, environmental and other contingencies and periodically determines when the Company should record losses for these items based on information available to the Company. \nShare-Based Payment Arrangements.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Company follows FASB ASC Topic 718,\nCompensation \xc2\x97 Stock Compensation (\xc2\x93FASB ASC 718\xc2\x94) which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including employee stock options, based on\nestimated fair values. Share-based compensation expense recognized under FASB ASC 718 for the years ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $5.6\xc2\xa0million, $4.1\xc2\xa0million and $5.5\xc2\xa0million, respectively. See Note\xc2\xa06 for\nadditional information.  Conversion of Barrels of Oil to Mcfe of\nGas.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Company converts barrels of oil and other liquid hydrocarbons to Mcfe at a ratio of one barrel of oil or liquids to six Mcfe. This conversion ratio, which is typically used in the oil and gas\nindustry, represents the approximate energy equivalent of a barrel of oil or other liquids to an Mcf of natural gas. The sales price of one barrel of oil or liquids has been much higher than the sales price of six Mcf of natural gas over the last\nseveral years, so a six to one conversion ratio does not represent the economic equivalency of six Mcf of natural gas to a barrel of oil or other liquids. \n \xc2\xa0 57 \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n Recent accounting pronouncements. \nRestricted Cash.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU\n2016-18,\xc2\xa0Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (\xc2\x93ASU No.\xc2\xa02016-18\xc2\x94). The guidance requires that an explanation is included in\nthe cash flow statement of the change in the total of (1)\xc2\xa0cash, (2) cash equivalents, and (3)\xc2\xa0restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. The ASU also clarifies that transfers between cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash or\nrestricted cash equivalents should not be reported as cash flow activities and requires the nature of the restrictions on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents to be disclosed. For public companies, the standard\nwill take effect for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December\xc2\xa015, 2017 with earlier application permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its\nconsolidated financial statements.  Statement of Cash Flows.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In August 2016, the\nFASB issued ASU 2016-15,\xc2\xa0Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) (\xc2\x93ASU No.\xc2\xa02016-15\xc2\x94). The guidance requires that debt prepayment or debt\nextinguishment costs, including third-party costs, premiums paid, and other fees paid to lenders, be classified as cash outflows for financing activities. For public companies, the standard will take effect for fiscal years, and interim periods\nwithin those fiscal years, beginning after December\xc2\xa015, 2017 with earlier application permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. \nShare-Based Payment.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update\n(\xc2\x93ASU\xc2\x94) 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (\xc2\x93ASU No.\xc2\xa02016-09\xc2\x94)\nto simplify some of the provisions in stock compensation accounting. The update simplifies the accounting for a stock payment\xc2\x92s tax consequences and amends how excess tax benefits and a business\xc2\x92s payments to cover the tax bills for the\nshares\xc2\x92 recipients should be classified. The amendments allow companies to estimate the number of stock awards expected to vest and revises the withholding requirements for classifying stock awards as equity. For public companies, the standard\nwill take effect for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December\xc2\xa015, 2016 with earlier application permitted. The Company is still evaluating the impact of ASU\nNo.\xc2\xa02016-09 on its financial position and results of operations. \nLeases.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In February 2016, the FASB issued\nASU2016-02, Leases (\xc2\x93ASU No.\xc2\xa02016-02\xc2\x94). The guidance requires that lessees will be required to recognize assets and liabilities on\nthe balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months. The ASU will also require disclosures designed to give financial statement users information on the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash\nflows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative information. For public companies, the standard will take effect for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December\xc2\xa015,\n2018 with earlier application permitted. The Company is still evaluating the impact of ASU No.\xc2\xa02016-02 on its financial position and results of operations. \nInventory.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU\n2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (\xc2\x93ASU No.\xc2\xa02015-11\xc2\x94). Public companies will have to apply the amendments\nfor reporting periods that start after December\xc2\xa015, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. This ASU requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated\nselling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The company does not expect the adoption of ASU No.\xc2\xa02015-11 to have a\nmaterial impact on its consolidated financial statements.  Debt Issuance\nCosts.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest \xc2\x97 Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) \xc2\x97 Simplifying the\nPresentation of Debt Issuance Costs. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, Interest \xc2\x97 Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) \xc2\x97 Presentation and\nSubsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements. These ASUs require capitalized debt issuance costs, except for those\nrelated to revolving credit facilities, to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, rather than as an asset. The Company \n\n \xc2\xa0 58 \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nadopted these ASUs on January\xc2\xa01, 2016, using a retrospective approach. The adoption resulted in a reclassification that reduced current assets and current maturities of long-term debt by\n$19.4\xc2\xa0million on the Company\xc2\x92s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December\xc2\xa031, 2015. A non-cash charge to write-off all of the unamortized debt issuance costs\nis included in Reorganization items, net at December\xc2\xa031, 2016 as the related debt instruments are expected to be impacted by the pendency of the Company\xc2\x92s chapter 11 cases. \nRevenue Recognition.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU\n2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and in 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus\nAgent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), and ASU 2016-10, Revenues from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which supersede the revenue\nrecognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and industry-specific guidance in Subtopic 932-605, Extractive Activities-Oil and Gas-Revenue Recognition. The new standard requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be\nentitled to in exchange for those goods or services.  We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU 2014-09 and assessing the impact, if any, it may have on our financial position and results of operations. As part of our assessment work to date, we have dedicated resources to the implementation, completed\ntraining of the new ASU\xc2\x92s revenue recognition model, and begun contract review and documentation. The primary impacts to the Company of adopting ASU 2014-09 relate to principal versus agent considerations\nand the use of the entitlements method for oil and natural gas sales, both of which are continuing to be evaluated by the Company.  The Company is required to adopt the new standards in the first quarter of 2018 using one of two application methods: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method),\nor retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the cumulative catch-up transition method). The Company is currently evaluating\nthe available adoption methods.  Going Concern.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In August 2014, the FASB issued\nASU No.\xc2\xa02014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity\xc2\x92s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (\xc2\x93ASU No.\xc2\xa02014-15\xc2\x94) that requires\nmanagement to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about the Company\xc2\x92s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the financial statements are issued on both an interim and annual\nbasis. Management is required to provide certain footnote disclosures if it concludes that substantial doubt exists or when its plans alleviate substantial doubt about the Company\xc2\x92s ability to continue as a going concern. ASU No.\xc2\xa02014-15 becomes effective for annual periods ending after December\xc2\xa015, 2016 and for interim reporting periods thereafter. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company\xc2\x92s\nConsolidated Financial Statements. \n \xc2\xa0 59 \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n Results of Operations \xc2\x97 Year

\nProduction.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016, production decreased on a gas\nequivalent basis to 281.7\xc2\xa0Bcfe from 290.1\xc2\xa0Bcfe for the same period in 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to decreased capital investment during the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016. \nCommodity prices \xc2\x97 natural gas.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Realized natural gas prices decreased to $2.31 per Mcf\nduring the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016 as compared to $2.59 per Mcf during 2015. The Company did not have any open \n \xc2\xa0 60 \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nderivative contracts for natural gas production during 2016. During the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015, the Company\xc2\x92s average price for natural gas was $3.14 per Mcf, including realized\ngains and losses on commodity derivatives.  Commodity prices \xc2\x97 oil.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During\nthe year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016, the average price realization for the Company\xc2\x92s oil was $38.24 per barrel compared with $40.31 per barrel during 2015. The Company did not have any open derivative contracts for oil production during 2016\nor 2015.  Revenues.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The decrease in average oil and natural gas prices and\ndecreased total production resulted in revenues decreasing to $721.1\xc2\xa0million for the for the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016 as compared to $839.1\xc2\xa0million in 2015.  Operating Costs and Expenses:  Lease Operating\nExpense.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lease operating expenses (\xc2\x93LOE\xc2\x94) decreased to $89.1\xc2\xa0million for the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016 compared to $106.9\xc2\xa0million during the same period in 2015 largely related to lower costs\ndue to improved efficiencies. On a unit of production basis, LOE costs decreased to $0.32 per Mcfe at December\xc2\xa031, 2016 compared to $0.37 per Mcfe at December\xc2\xa031, 2015. \nLiquids Gathering System Operating Lease Expense.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During December 2012, the Company\nsold a system of liquids gathering pipelines and central gathering facilities (the \xc2\x93Pinedale LGS\xc2\x94) and certain associated real property rights in the Pinedale Anticline in Wyoming. The Company entered into a long-term, triple net lease\nagreement with the buyer relating to the use of the Pinedale LGS (the \xc2\x93Pinedale Lease Agreement\xc2\x94). The Pinedale Lease Agreement provides for an initial term of 15 years, and annual rent for the initial term under the Pinedale Lease\nAgreement is $20.0\xc2\xa0million (as adjusted annually for changes based on the consumer price index) and may increase if certain volume thresholds are exceeded. The lease is classified as an operating lease. For the year ended December\xc2\xa031,\n2016, the Company recognized operating lease expense associated with the Pinedale Lease Agreement of $20.7\xc2\xa0million, or $0.07 per Mcfe compared with $20.6\xc2\xa0million, or $0.07 per Mcfe in 2015. \nProduction Taxes.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016, production taxes were\n$69.7\xc2\xa0million compared to $72.8\xc2\xa0million during the same period in 2015, or $0.25 per Mcfe in 2016, compared to $0.25 per Mcfe in 2015. Production taxes are primarily calculated based on a percentage of revenue from production in Wyoming\nand Utah after certain deductions and were 9.7% of revenues for the year ended 2016 and 8.7% for the same period in 2015. The decrease in production taxes is primarily attributable to decreased oil and natural gas prices during the year\nDecember\xc2\xa031, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.  Gathering\nFees.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Gathering fees decreased slightly to $86.8\xc2\xa0million for the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016 compared to $87.9\xc2\xa0million during the same period in 2015. On a per unit basis, gathering fees increased slightly\nto $0.31 per Mcfe for the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016 as compared to $0.30 per Mcfe for the period ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015.  Transportation Charges.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Transportation charges decreased to $20.0\xc2\xa0million for the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016 as compared to $83.8\xc2\xa0million for the same period\nin 2015 primarily as a result of the termination of the Rockies Express contract during the second quarter of 2016. See Note 13 and Note 11 for further discussion of the Rockies Express contract. \nDepletion, Depreciation and Amortization.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0DD&A expenses decreased to\n$125.1\xc2\xa0million during the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016 from $401.2\xc2\xa0million for the same period in 2015, attributable to a decreased depletion rate on a unit of production basis as a result of the ceiling test impairment during the\nfourth quarter of 2015. On a unit of production basis, DD&A decreased to $0.44 per Mcfe at December\xc2\xa031, 2016 from $1.38 per Mcfe at December\xc2\xa031, 2015. \n \xc2\xa0 61 \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n Ceiling Test Write-Down.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Company recorded\na $3.1\xc2\xa0billion non-cash write-down of the carrying value of its proved oil and natural gas properties for the period ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015 as a result of ceiling test limitations, which is\nreflected as ceiling test and other impairments in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The ceiling test was calculated based upon the average of quoted market prices in effect on the first day of the month for the preceding\ntwelve month period at December\xc2\xa031, 2015 for Henry Hub natural gas and West Texas Intermediate oil, adjusted for market differentials. The write-down reduced earnings in the period and will result in lower a DD&A rate in future periods. The\nCompany did not have any write-downs related to the full cost ceiling limitation during the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016.  General and Administrative Expenses.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0General and administrative expenses increased to $9.2\xc2\xa0million for the period ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016 compared to\n$7.4\xc2\xa0million for the same period in 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to reversal of certain incentive compensation expense during the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015. On a per unit basis,\ngeneral and administrative expenses remained flat at $0.03 per Mcfe for the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016 and 2015. \nOther Income and Expenses:  Interest Expense.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Interest expense decreased to $66.6\xc2\xa0million during the period ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016 compared to $171.9\xc2\xa0million during the same period in\n2015.

Restructuring\nExpenses.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016, the Company incurred $7.2\xc2\xa0million in costs and fees in connection with its efforts to restructure its debt prior to filing the chapter 11 petitions. \nContract Settlement.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contract settlement of $131.1\xc2\xa0million for the year ended\nDecember\xc2\xa031, 2016 relates to the contract settlement reached with REX.  Deferred Gain on Sale of\nLiquids Gathering System.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During the years ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $10.6\xc2\xa0million in deferred gain on sale of the liquids gathering system relating to the sale of a system of\npipelines and central gathering facilities and certain associated real property rights in the Pinedale Anticline in Wyoming during December 2012.  Commodity Derivatives:  Gain on Commodity\nDerivatives.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Company does not currently have any open commodity derivative contracts. During the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015, the Company recognized a gain of $42.6\xc2\xa0million related to commodity derivatives.\nOf this total, the Company recognized $146.8\xc2\xa0million related to realized gain during the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015. The realized gain or loss on commodity derivatives relates to actual amounts received or paid under the\nCompany\xc2\x92s derivative contracts. This gain or loss on commodity derivatives also includes a $104.2\xc2\xa0million unrealized loss on commodity derivatives at December\xc2\xa031, 2015. The unrealized gain or loss on commodity derivatives represents\nthe change in the fair value of these derivative instruments over the remaining term of the contract.  Reorganization\nItems:  Reorganization Items, Net.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reorganization items, net of\n$47.5\xc2\xa0million for the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016 include the contract settlement of $17.35\xc2\xa0million related to a settlement reached with Big West Oil, LLC. Reorganization items, net also includes professional fees of\n$11.8\xc2\xa0million and a non-cash charge to write-off all unamortized debt issuance costs totaling $18.7\xc2\xa0million related to the unsecured Credit Agreement, the\nunsecured \n \xc2\xa0 62 \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nSenior Notes issued by Ultra Resources, the unsecured 2018 Senior Notes issued by the Company and the unsecured 2024 Senior Notes issued by the Company as these debt instruments are expected to\nbe impacted by the pendency of the Company\xc2\x92s chapter 11 cases.  Income from Continuing Operations:\n Pretax Income.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Company recognized income before income taxes of\n$55.5\xc2\xa0million for the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016 compared with a loss of $3.2\xc2\xa0billion for the same period in 2015. The increase in earnings is primarily related to the non-cash ceiling test\nimpairment incurred during 2015 and decreased DD&A, reduced interest expense and reduced transportation charges during the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016; and partially offset by costs associated with the reorganization and decreased revenues\nas a result of lower oil and natural gas prices for the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.  Income Taxes.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Company has recorded a valuation allowance against substantially all of its net deferred tax asset balance as of December\xc2\xa031, 2016.

The increase in earnings is primarily related to the non-cash ceiling test impairment incurred during 2015 and decreased DD&A, reduced interest expense and reduced transportation\ncharges during the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016; and partially offset by costs associated with the reorganization and decreased revenues as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices for the year ended

During 2014, the average price realization for the\nCompany\xc2\x92s oil was $76.32, including realized gains and losses on commodity derivatives. \nRevenues.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The decrease in average oil and natural gas prices, excluding the gains and\nlosses on commodity derivatives, offset by increased production from the properties acquired in the SWEPI Transaction and our drilling program resulted in revenues decreasing to $839.1\xc2\xa0million for the for the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015\nas compared to $1.2\xc2\xa0billion in 2014.  Operating Costs and Expenses: \nLease Operating Expense.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lease operating expenses (\xc2\x93LOE\xc2\x94) increased to\n$106.9\xc2\xa0million for the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015 compared to $96.5\xc2\xa0million during the same period in 2014 largely related to increased production associated with the SWEPI Transaction and our drilling program. On a unit of\nproduction basis, LOE costs decreased to $0.37 per Mcfe at December\xc2\xa031, 2015 compared to $0.39 per Mcfe at December\xc2\xa031, 2014.  Liquids Gathering System Operating Lease Expense.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During December 2012, the Company sold a system of liquids gathering pipelines and central gathering facilities (the\n\xc2\x93Pinedale LGS\xc2\x94) and certain associated real property rights in the Pinedale Anticline in Wyoming. The Company entered into a long-term, triple net lease agreement with the buyer relating to the use of the Pinedale LGS (the \xc2\x93Pinedale\nLease Agreement\xc2\x94). The Pinedale Lease Agreement provides for an initial term of 15 years, and annual rent for the initial term under the Pinedale Lease Agreement is $20.0\xc2\xa0million (as adjusted annually for changes based on the consumer\nprice index) and may increase if certain volume thresholds are exceeded. The lease is classified as an operating lease. For the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015, the Company recognized operating lease expense associated with the Pinedale Lease\nAgreement of $20.6\xc2\xa0million, or $0.07 per Mcfe compared with $20.3\xc2\xa0million, or $0.08 per Mcfe in 2014. \nProduction Taxes.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015, production taxes were\n$72.8\xc2\xa0million compared to $103.9\xc2\xa0million during the same period in 2014, or $0.25 per Mcfe, compared to $0.42 per Mcfe. Production taxes are primarily calculated based on a percentage of revenue from production in Wyoming and Utah after\ncertain deductions and were 8.7% of revenues for the year ended 2015 and 8.4% for the same period in 2014. The decrease in per unit taxes is primarily attributable to decreased natural gas prices, excluding the effects of commodity derivatives,\nduring the year December\xc2\xa031, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014.  Gathering\nFees.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Gathering fees increased to $87.9\xc2\xa0million for the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015 compared to $59.9\xc2\xa0million during the same period in 2014 largely related to production increases in Wyoming. On a per unit\nbasis, gathering fees increased to $0.30 per Mcfe for the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015 as compared to $0.24 per Mcfe for the period ended December\xc2\xa031, 2014 primarily due to higher gathering rates in Wyoming compared to Pennsylvania.\n Transportation Charges.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Company incurred firm transportation charges\ntotaling $83.8\xc2\xa0million for the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015 as compared to $77.8\xc2\xa0million for the same period in 2014 in association with REX transportation charges. Transportation charges increased due to a refund received during the\nsecond quarter of 2014 for over collection of tariffs related to Fuel, Loss and Unaccounted-for-Gas applicable to transport on REX\xc2\x92s system. On a per unit basis,\ntransportation charges decreased to $0.29 per Mcfe (on total company volumes) for the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015 as compared to $0.31 per Mcfe for the same period in 2014 primarily as a result of increased production volumes. \n \xc2\xa0 65 \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n Depletion, Depreciation and\nAmortization.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0DD&A expenses increased to $401.2\xc2\xa0million during the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015 from $293.0\xc2\xa0million for the same period in 2014, attributable to a higher depletion rate and increased\nproduction. On a unit of production basis, DD&A increased to $1.38 per Mcfe at December\xc2\xa031, 2015 from $1.18 per Mcfe at December\xc2\xa031, 2014 primarily related to decreased reserves as a result of not including PUD reserves in total proved\nreserve estimates at December\xc2\xa031, 2015 due to uncertainty regarding our ability to continue as a going concern and the availability of capital that would be required to develop the PUD reserves. \nCeiling Test Write-Down.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Company recorded a $3.1\xc2\xa0billion non-cash write-down of the carrying value of its proved oil and natural gas properties for the period ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015 as a result of ceiling test limitations, which is reflected as ceiling test and\nother impairments in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The ceiling test was calculated based upon the average of quoted market prices in effect on the first day of the month for the preceding twelve month period at\nDecember\xc2\xa031, 2015 for Henry Hub natural gas and West Texas Intermediate oil, adjusted for market differentials. The write-down reduced earnings in the period and will result in lower a DD&A rate in future periods. The Company did not have\nany write-downs related to the full cost ceiling limitation during the prior year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2014. \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0General and administrative expenses decreased to\n$7.4\xc2\xa0million for the period ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015 compared to $19.1\xc2\xa0million for the same period in 2014. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to decreased incentive compensation expense and\npersonnel and overhead charges allocated to the increased wells as a result of the SWEPI Transaction. On a per unit basis, general and administrative expenses decreased to $0.03 per Mcfe for the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015 as compared to $0.08\nper Mcfe for the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2014 as a result of decreased costs and increased production.  Other\nIncome and Expenses:  Interest Expense.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Interest expense increased to\n$171.9\xc2\xa0million during the period ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015 compared to $126.2\xc2\xa0million during the same period in 2014 primarily as a result of higher average borrowings outstanding during the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015 and\ndecreased amounts of capitalized interest for the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015. For the years ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015 and 2014, the Company capitalized $13.1\xc2\xa0million and $20.4\xc2\xa0million, respectively, in interest associated with\nunevaluated oil and gas properties that were excluded from amortization and actively being evaluated as well as work in process relating to gathering systems that are not currently in service. \nLitigation Expense\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015, the Company recognized\nlitigation expenses of $4.4\xc2\xa0million related to the resolution of litigation matters.  Deferred Gain on\nSale of Liquids Gathering System.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During the years ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized $10.6\xc2\xa0million in deferred gain on sale of the liquids gathering system relating to the sale of a system\nof pipelines and central gathering facilities and certain associated real property rights in the Pinedale Anticline in Wyoming during December 2012.  Commodity Derivatives:  Gain (Loss) on Commodity\nDerivatives.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015, the Company recognized a gain of $42.6\xc2\xa0million compared with a gain of $82.4\xc2\xa0million related to commodity derivatives during the year ended\nDecember\xc2\xa031, 2014. Of this total, the Company recognized $146.8\xc2\xa0million related to realized gain on commodity derivatives as compared to $47.7\xc2\xa0million related to realized loss during the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2014. The\nrealized gain or loss on commodity derivatives relates to actual amounts received or paid under the Company\xc2\x92s derivative contracts. This gain or loss on commodity derivatives also includes a $104.2\xc2\xa0million unrealized loss on commodity\nderivatives at December\xc2\xa031, 2015 as compared to a $130.1\xc2\xa0million \n \xc2\xa0 66 \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nunrealized gain on commodity derivatives at December\xc2\xa031, 2014. The unrealized gain or loss on commodity derivatives represents the change in the fair value of these derivative instruments\nover the remaining term of the contract.  Income from Continuing Operations: \nPretax Income.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Company recognized a loss before income taxes of $3.2\xc2\xa0billion for\nthe year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015 compared with income of $537.0\xc2\xa0million for the same period in 2014. The decrease in earnings is primarily related to the non-cash ceiling test impairment and\ndecreased revenues as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices partially offset by increased production for the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014. \nIncome Taxes.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Company has recorded a valuation allowance against substantially all of\nits net deferred tax asset balance as of December\xc2\xa031, 2015. Some or all of this valuation allowance may be reversed in future periods against future income. The income tax benefit recognized for the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015 was\n$4.4\xc2\xa0million compared with an income tax benefit of $5.8\xc2\xa0million for the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2014.  Net Income.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015, the Company recognized a net loss of $3.2\xc2\xa0billion or -$20.94 per diluted\nshare as compared with net income of $542.9\xc2\xa0million or $3.51 per diluted share for the same period in 2014. The decrease in earnings is primarily related to the non-cash ceiling test impairment and\ndecreased revenues as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices partially offset by increased production for the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Liquidity Before Filing Under\nChapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code  We have historically funded our operations primarily\nthrough cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under the Credit Agreement, proceeds from the issuance of debt and proceeds from asset sales. However, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, and are highly dependent on the\nprices we receive for oil and natural gas. Oil and natural gas prices declined severely during fiscal year 2015 and declined even further during the first quarter of 2016. The Henry Hub natural gas spot price dropped below $1.65 per MMBtu in March\n2016 for the first time in 17 years. Although natural gas prices have improved in recent months, there is still significant volatility in commodity prices and these prices are still lower than the industry has experienced in recent years. These\nlower commodity prices have negatively impacted revenues, earnings and cash flows, and sustained low oil and natural gas prices will have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity position. \nLiquidity After Filing Under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code \nAs described in Note 1, the filing of the chapter 11 petitions constituted an event of default with respect to our\nexisting debt obligations. However, subject to certain exceptions under the Bankruptcy Code, the filing of the chapter 11 petitions automatically enjoined, or stayed, the continuation of any judicial or administrative proceedings or other actions\nagainst the Debtors or their property to recover, collect or secure a claim arising prior to the filing of the chapter 11 petitions. Thus, for example, most creditor actions to obtain possession of property from the Debtors, or to create, perfect or\nenforce any lien against the Debtors\xc2\x92 property, or to collect on monies owed or otherwise exercise rights or remedies with respect to a pre-petition claim are enjoined unless and until the Bankruptcy\nCourt lifts the automatic stay.  The Bankruptcy Court has approved payment of certain prepetition obligations,\nincluding payments for employee wages, salaries and certain other benefits, customer programs, taxes, utilities, insurance, surety bond premiums as well as payments to possessory lien vendors. Despite the liquidity provided by our existing cash on\n\n \xc2\xa0 67 \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nhand, our ability to maintain normal credit terms with our suppliers may become impaired. We may be required to pay cash in advance to certain vendors and may experience restrictions on the\navailability of trade credit, which would further reduce our liquidity. If liquidity problems persist, our suppliers could refuse to provide key products and services in the future. In addition, due to the public perception of our financial\ncondition and results of operations, in particular with regard to our potential failure to meet our debt obligations, some vendors could be reluctant to enter into long-term agreements with us. \nAlthough we have lowered our capital budget as compared to 2015, our business remains capital intensive. In addition to\nthe cash requirements necessary to fund ongoing operations, we have incurred significant professional fees and other costs in connection with our chapter 11 proceedings and expect that we will continue to incur significant professional fees and\ncosts throughout our chapter 11 proceedings. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity, including approximately $401.5\xc2\xa0million of cash on hand as of December\xc2\xa031, 2016 and funds generated from ongoing operations, to fund anticipated\ncash requirements through the chapter 11 proceedings for operating and capital expenditures and for working capital purposes and excluding principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt. \nThe Company does not intend to seek\ndebtor-in-possession (\xc2\x93DIP\xc2\x94) financing at this time. However, given the current level of volatility in the market and the unpredictability of certain costs\nthat could potentially arise in our operations, our liquidity needs could be significantly higher than we currently anticipate. There are no assurances that our current liquidity is sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations related to the\nchapter 11 cases, proceed with the confirmation of a chapter 11 plan of reorganization and emerge from bankruptcy. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to secure additional interim financing sufficient to meet our liquidity needs or, if\nsufficient funds are available, offered to us on acceptable terms.  Our ability to maintain adequate\nliquidity through the reorganization process and beyond depends on successful operation of our business, and appropriate management of operating expenses and capital spending. Our anticipated liquidity needs are highly sensitive to changes in each\nof these and other factors.  Going Concern.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and satisfaction of\nliabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Consolidated Financial Statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result from the outcome of our chapter 11 proceedings. We have significant indebtedness, all of which we\nhave reclassified to liabilities subject to compromise at December\xc2\xa031, 2016. Our level of indebtedness has adversely impacted and is continuing to adversely impact our financial condition. As a result of our financial condition, the defaults\nunder our debt agreements, and the risks and uncertainties surrounding our chapter 11 proceedings, substantial doubt exists that we will be able to continue as a going concern. \nInvestors should review the disclosures and other information, including the risk factors included in Item\xc2\xa01A.\n Capital Expenditures.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016, total\ncapital expenditures were $269.6\xc2\xa0million. During this period, the Company participated in 110 gross (78.4 net) wells in Wyoming that were drilled to total depth and cased. The Company also completed 13 drilled but uncompleted wells in Utah\nduring 2016. No wells were drilled in Utah or Pennsylvania during 2016.  2017 Capital Investment\nPlan.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For 2017, our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $500.0\xc2\xa0million. We expect to fund these capital expenditures through cash flows from operations and cash on hand. We expect to allocate\nnearly all of the budget to development activities in our Pinedale field.  Other\nDevelopments.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Trading in the Company\xc2\x92s common stock on the NYSE was suspended on May\xc2\xa03, 2016 and the common stock was delisted. The common stock of the Company currently trades on the OTC Pink marketplace\nunder the symbol \xc2\x93UPLMQ\xc2\x94. \n \xc2\xa0 68 \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n Ultra Resources, Inc. \nBank indebtedness.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ultra Resources, Inc. (\xc2\x93Ultra Resources\xc2\x94), a wholly\nowned subsidiary of the Company, is a party to the Credit Agreement. Ultra Resources\xc2\x92 obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and UP Energy Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. \nUltra Resources\xc2\x92 filing of the chapter 11 petitions described in Note 1 constituted an event of default that\naccelerated its obligations under the Credit Agreement. Other events of default are also present with respect to the Credit Agreement, including a failure to make interest payments and, as described below, a failure to deliver annual audited\nconsolidated financial statements without a going concern qualification, a failure to meet the minimum PV-9 ratio covenant and a failure to comply with the consolidated leverage covenant in the Credit\nAgreement at the end of the first quarter of 2016. The Credit Agreement provides that upon the acceleration of Ultra Resources\xc2\x92 obligations under the Credit Agreement, the outstanding balance of loans extended under the Credit Agreement comes\ndue, unpaid interest accrued as of the time of the acceleration comes due, and any fees or other obligations of the borrower come due. Under the Bankruptcy Code, the creditors under the Credit Agreement are stayed from taking any action against\nUltra Resources or any of the other Debtors as a result of the default.  Prior to April\xc2\xa029, 2016, loans\nunder the Credit Agreement bore interest, at the borrower\xc2\x92s option, based on (A)\xc2\xa0a rate per annum equal to the prime rate or the weighted average fed funds rate on overnight transactions during the preceding business day plus a margin\nbased on a grid of the borrower\xc2\x92s consolidated leverage ratio, or (B)\xc2\xa0a base Eurodollar rate, substantially equal to the LIBOR rate, plus a margin based on a grid of the borrower\xc2\x92s consolidated leverage ratio. \nThe Credit Agreement requires us to deliver annual audited, consolidated financial statements for the Company without a\n\xc2\x93going concern\xc2\x94 or like qualification or explanation. On March\xc2\xa015, 2016, we delivered an audit report with respect to the financial statements in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K that\nincluded an explanatory paragraph expressing uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a \xc2\x93going concern.\xc2\x94  The Credit Agreement contains a consolidated leverage covenant, pursuant to which Ultra Resources is required to maintain a maximum ratio of its total funded consolidated debt to its trailing four fiscal\nquarters\xc2\x92 EBITDAX of 3.5 to 1.0. Based on Ultra Resources\xc2\x92 EBITDAX for the trailing four fiscal quarters ended March\xc2\xa031, 2016, we were not in compliance with this consolidated leverage covenant at March\xc2\xa031, 2016 (the ratio was\n4.6 times at March\xc2\xa031, 2016).  The Credit Agreement contains a\nPV-9 covenant, pursuant to which Ultra Resources is required to maintain a minimum ratio of the discounted net present value of its oil and gas properties to its total funded consolidated debt of 1.5 times. We\nwere required to report whether we were in compliance with this covenant on April\xc2\xa01, 2016. Based on the PV-9 of its oil and gas properties at December\xc2\xa031, 2015, Ultra Resources failed to comply with\nthe PV-9 ratio covenant under the Credit Agreement (the ratio was 0.9 times at December\xc2\xa031, 2015).  Senior Notes.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ultra Resources has outstanding $1.46\xc2\xa0billion of Senior Notes which were issued pursuant to a certain Master Note Purchase Agreement dated as of\nMarch\xc2\xa06, 2008 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the \xc2\x93MNPA\xc2\x94). The Ultra Resources\xc2\x92 Senior Notes rank pari passu with the Credit Agreement. Payment of the Senior Notes is guaranteed by the Company and by UP Energy\nCorporation. The Ultra Resources\xc2\x92 Senior Notes are subject to representations, warranties, covenants and events of default similar to those in the Credit Agreement. \nUltra Resources\xc2\x92 filing of the chapter 11 petitions described in Note 1 constituted an event of default that\naccelerated its obligations under the MNPA and the Senior Notes. Other events of default are also present with respect to the MNPA, including a failure to comply with the consolidated leverage covenant at the end of the first quarter of 2016 and a\nfailure to make principal and interest payments due under the Ultra Resources\xc2\x92 Senior \n \xc2\xa0 69 \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nNotes. The MNPA provides that upon the acceleration of Ultra Resources\xc2\x92 obligations under the MNPA and the Senior Notes, among other matters, the Senior Notes are deemed to have matured, the\nunpaid principal balance of the Senior Notes comes due, unpaid interest accrued as of the time of the acceleration comes due, and any applicable Make-Whole Amount (as determined pursuant to the MNPA) comes due. Under the Bankruptcy Code, the\ncreditors under the Senior Notes are stayed from taking any action against Ultra Resources or any of the other the Debtors as a result of the default.  The MNPA contains a consolidated leverage covenant, pursuant to which Ultra Resources is required to maintain a maximum ratio of its total funded consolidated debt to its trailing four fiscal\nquarters\xc2\x92 EBITDAX of 3.5 to 1.0. Based on Ultra Resources\xc2\x92 EBITDAX for the trailing four fiscal quarters ended March\xc2\xa031, 2016, we were not in compliance with this consolidated leverage covenant at March\xc2\xa031, 2016 (the ratio was\n4.6 times at March\xc2\xa031, 2016).  On March\xc2\xa01, 2016, we failed to make an interest payment of\napproximately $40.0\xc2\xa0million and a principal payment of $62.0\xc2\xa0million, each of which was due March\xc2\xa01, 2016 under the terms of the Ultra Resources\xc2\x92 Senior Notes. We entered into a forbearance agreement related to the failure to\nmake these payments with the holders of the Ultra Resources\xc2\x92 Senior Notes, and we filed the chapter 11 petitions without making the payments before the forbearance period expired. \nInterest Expense.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No interest expense has been recognized with respect to the Credit\nAgreement or the Ultra Resources\xc2\x92 Senior Notes subsequent to the Petition Date.  Ultra Petroleum Corp. Senior Notes\n The Company\xc2\x92s filing of the chapter 11 petitions described in Note 1 constituted an event of\ndefault that accelerated the Company\xc2\x92s obligations under the 2024 Notes and the 2018 Notes (defined below). Additionally, other events of default, including cross-defaults, are present due to the failure to make interest payments and other\nmatters. Under the indentures pursuant to which the 2024 Notes and the 2018 Notes, respectively, were issued, upon the acceleration of the Company\xc2\x92s obligations under the 2024 Notes and the 2018 Notes, among other matters, the 2024 Notes and\nthe 2018 Notes, respectively, are deemed to have matured, the unpaid principal balance of the 2024 Notes and the 2018 Notes, respectively, comes due, unpaid interest accrued as of the time of the acceleration comes due, and any applicable premiums\n(as determined pursuant to the indentures) comes due. Under the Bankruptcy Code, the creditors under the 2024 Notes and the 2018 Notes are stayed from taking any action against the Debtors as a result of the default. \nSenior Notes due 2024:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On September\xc2\xa018, 2014, the Company issued\n$850.0\xc2\xa0million of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2024 (\xc2\x932024 Notes\xc2\x94). The 2024 Notes are general, unsecured senior obligations of the Company and mature on October\xc2\xa01, 2024. The 2024 Notes rank equally in right of payment to all existing\nand future senior indebtedness of the Company and effectively rank junior to all future secured indebtedness of the Company (to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness). The 2024 Notes are not guaranteed by the\nCompany\xc2\x92s subsidiaries and, as a result, are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other obligations of the Company\xc2\x92s subsidiaries. The 2024 Notes are subject to covenants that restrict the Company\xc2\x92s ability to incur\nindebtedness, make distributions and other restricted payments, grant liens, use the proceeds of asset sales, make investments and engage in affiliate transactions. \nInterest due under the 2024 Notes is payable each April\xc2\xa01 and October 1. On April\xc2\xa01, 2016, we elected to defer\nmaking an interest payment on the 2024 Notes of approximately $26.0\xc2\xa0million due April\xc2\xa01, 2016. The indenture governing the 2024 Notes provides a 30-day grace period for us to make this interest\npayment. We did not make this interest payment before the end of the grace period, which resulted in an event of default under the indenture governing the 2024 Notes. \nSenior Notes due 2018:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On December\xc2\xa012, 2013, the Company issued\n$450.0\xc2\xa0million of 5.75% Senior Notes due 2018 (\xc2\x932018 Notes\xc2\x94). The 2018 Notes are general, unsecured senior obligations of the Company and \n \xc2\xa0 70 \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \nmature on December\xc2\xa015, 2018. The 2018 Notes rank equally in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness of the Company and effectively rank junior to all future secured\nindebtedness of the Company (to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness). The 2018 Notes are not guaranteed by the Company\xc2\x92s subsidiaries and, as a result, are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other\nobligations of the Company\xc2\x92s subsidiaries. The 2018 Notes are subject to covenants that restrict the Company\xc2\x92s ability to incur indebtedness, make distributions and other restricted payments, grant liens, use the proceeds of asset sales,\nmake investments and engage in affiliate transactions. Interest due under the 2018 Notes is payable each June\xc2\xa015 and December 15.  The Company\xc2\x92s filing of the chapter 11 petitions described in Note 1 constituted an event of default that accelerated the Company\xc2\x92s obligations under the 2024 Notes and the 2018 Notes.\nAdditionally, other events of default, including cross-defaults resulting from the acceleration of indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement and the Ultra Resources\xc2\x92 Senior Notes, are present due to the failure to make interest\npayments and other matters. Under the Bankruptcy Code, the creditors under the 2024 Notes and the 2018 Notes are stayed from taking any action against the Debtors as a result of the bankruptcy filing. \nInterest Expense.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No interest expense has been recognized with respect to the 2018\nNotes or 2024 Notes subsequent to the Petition Date.  Cash flows provided by (used in): \nOperating Activities.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016, net cash provided\nby operating activities was $307.6\xc2\xa0million, a 40% decrease from $515.5\xc2\xa0million for the same period in 2015. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was largely attributable to decreased revenues as a result of decreased\noil and natural gas price realizations and partially offset by a decrease in post-petition interest expense during the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 and net changes in working capital. \nInvesting Activities.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016, net cash used in\ninvesting activities was $278.9\xc2\xa0million as compared to $512.8\xc2\xa0million for the same period in 2015. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities is largely related to decreased capital investments associated with the Company\xc2\x92s\ndrilling activities in 2016 as compared to 2015.  Financing\nActivities.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During the year ended December\xc2\xa031, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $368.6\xc2\xa0million as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $7.6\xc2\xa0million for the same period\nin 2015. The change in cash provided by net financing activities is primarily due to increased borrowings during 2016, primarily related to drawings under the Credit Agreement.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  The Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December\xc2\xa031, 2016.

See Note 1.  The chapter\n11 filings by the Company and its various subsidiaries, including Ultra Resources, constituted events of default under the Company\xc2\x92s debt agreements. On or around September\xc2\xa01, 2016, many of the holders of this indebtedness filed proofs of\nclaim with the Bankruptcy Court, asserting claims for the outstanding balance of the indebtedness, unpaid interest that had accrued by the petition dates, interest that has accrued since the petition dates (including interest at the default rates\nunder the debt agreements),\xc2\xa0make-whole amounts, and other fees and obligations under the debt agreements. On December\xc2\xa029, 2016, holders of certain Senior Notes (as defined below) filed a complaint initiating an adversary proceeding against\nus in our chapter 11 cases. In the complaint, among other matters, the noteholders allege that there is a make-whole amount due under the Senior Notes as a result of our filing the chapter 11 cases, which they assert is \xc2\x93no less than\n$200,725,869, exclusive of any interest thereon.\xc2\x94 On January\xc2\xa013, 2017, holders of certain other Senior Notes intervened to join the adversary proceeding as plaintiffs. On January\xc2\xa030, 2017, we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.\nOn February\xc2\xa010, 2017, both noteholder groups objected to our motion to dismiss. On February\xc2\xa013, 2017, the Court set a briefing schedule and a hearing date for April\xc2\xa020, 2017 for resolution of the make-whole and interest claims. At\nthis time, we are not able to determine the likelihood or range of amounts attributable to claims for postpetition interest, make-whole amounts, or other fees and obligations under the debt agreements. We anticipate these claims will be resolved\nduring our chapter 11 proceedings, although it is possible resolution of some of these matters could occur after we emerge from chapter 11.  Ultra Resources\xc2\x92 filing of the chapter 11 petitions constituted an event of default that accelerated its obligations under the Credit Agreement. Other events of default are also present with respect\nto the Credit Agreement, including a failure to make interest payments and, as described in Note 5, a failure to deliver annual audited consolidated financial statements without a going concern qualification, a failure to meet the minimum PV-9 ratio covenant and a failure to comply with the consolidated leverage covenant in the Credit Agreement at the end of the first quarter of 2016. The Credit Agreement provides that upon the acceleration of Ultra\nResources\xc2\x92 obligations under the Credit Agreement, the outstanding balance of loans extended under the Credit Agreement comes due, unpaid interest accrued as of the time of the acceleration comes due, and any fees or other obligations of the\nborrower come due. Under the Bankruptcy Code, the creditors under the Credit Agreement are stayed from taking any action against Ultra Resources or any of the other Debtors as a result of the default. \nUltra Resources has outstanding $1.46\xc2\xa0billion of senior notes (\xc2\x93Senior Notes\xc2\x94) which were issued pursuant\nto a certain Master Note Purchase Agreement dated as of March\xc2\xa06, 2008 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the \xc2\x93MNPA\xc2\x94). Ultra Resources\xc2\x92 filing of the chapter 11 petitions constituted an event of default that\naccelerated its obligations under the MNPA and the Senior Notes. Other events of default are also present with respect to the MNPA, including a failure to comply with the consolidated leverage covenant at the end of the first quarter of 2016 and a\nfailure to make principal and interest payments due under the Ultra Resources\xc2\x92 Senior Notes. The MNPA provides that upon the acceleration of Ultra Resources\xc2\x92 obligations under the MNPA and the Senior Notes, among other matters, the Senior\nNotes are deemed to have matured, the unpaid principal balance of the Senior Notes comes due, unpaid interest accrued as of the time of the acceleration comes due, and any applicable make-whole amount (as determined pursuant to the MNPA) comes due.\nUnder the Bankruptcy Code, the creditors under the Senior Notes are stayed from taking any action against Ultra Resources or any of the other the Debtors as a result of the default. \nThe Company\xc2\x92s filing of the chapter 11 petitions constituted an event of default that accelerated the Company\xc2\x92s\nobligations under the 2024 Notes and the 2018 Notes. Additionally, other events of default, including cross-defaults, are present due to the failure to make interest payments and other matters. Under the indentures pursuant to which the 2024 Notes\nand the 2018 Notes, respectively, were issued, upon the acceleration of the Company\xc2\x92s obligations under the 2024 Notes and the 2018 Notes, among other matters, the 2024 Notes and the \n \xc2\xa0 72 \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n \n2018 Notes, respectively, are deemed to have matured, the unpaid principal balance of the 2024 Notes and the 2018 Notes, respectively, comes due, unpaid interest accrued as of the time of the\nacceleration comes due, and any applicable premiums (as determined pursuant to the indentures) comes due. Under the Bankruptcy Code, the creditors under the 2024 Notes and the 2018 Notes are stayed from taking any action against the Debtors as a\nresult of the default.  Scheduled interest obligations.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No interest expense has\nbeen recognized with respect to the Credit Agreement, the Ultra Resources\xc2\x92 Senior Notes, the 2018 Notes or the 2024 Notes subsequent to the Petition Date. Due to the ongoing chapter 11 proceedings, these amounts cannot be reasonably estimated.\n Transportation contract.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Between 2009 and early 2016, the Company was a\nparty to agreements that provided the Company with firm transportation services on the Rockies Express Pipeline, including a Capacity Release Agreement, dated March\xc2\xa05, 2009, with Sempra Rockies Marketing, LLC (\xc2\x93Sempra\xc2\x94), and a Firm\nTransportation Negotiated Rate Agreement No.\xc2\xa0553082, dated June\xc2\xa05, 2008, with Rockies Express Pipeline, LLC (\xc2\x93REX\xc2\x94). During March and April 2016, both Sempra and REX delivered notices to the Company asserting that these\nagreements were terminated as a result of defaults by the Company. Both Sempra and REX filed proofs of claim in connection with our on-going chapter 11 proceedings. With respect to the proof of claim filed by\nREX, on January\xc2\xa012, 2017, REX and the Company entered into a settlement agreement resolving all of REX\xc2\x92s prepetition claims against the Company. Please see the discussion of these matters in the Commitments and Contingencies section of\nthis Report on Form 10-K for additional information. In connection with the settlement of REX\xc2\x92s proof of claim, the Company agreed to enter into a new first transportation agreement pursuant to which the\nCompany will have firm transportation capacity of 200,000 Dekatherms per day on the Rockies Express Pipeline, beginning December\xc2\xa01, 2019 and extending for a term expiring December\xc2\xa031, 2026. This new agreement will provide the Company with\nthe opportunity to transport a portion of its natural gas production away from its properties in Wyoming to capture improved basis differentials available at sales points along the Rockies Express Pipeline, if any. Please see Note 13 for further\ndetails.  Operating lease.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During December 2012, the Company sold its system of\npipelines and central gathering facilities (the \xc2\x93Pinedale LGS\xc2\x94) and certain associated real property rights in the Pinedale Anticline in Wyoming and entered into a long-term, triple net lease agreement (the \xc2\x93Pinedale Operating Lease\nAgreement\xc2\x94) relating to the use of the Pinedale LGS. The Pinedale Operating Lease Agreement provides for an initial term of 15 years and potential successive renewal terms of 5 years or 75% of the then remaining useful life of the Pinedale LGS\nat the sole discretion of the Company. Annual rent for the initial term under the Pinedale Operating Lease Agreement is $20.0\xc2\xa0million (as adjusted annually for changes based on the consumer price index, which is 1.05% at January\xc2\xa01, 2017)\nand may increase if certain volume thresholds are exceeded. The lease is classified as an operating lease.  On\nNovember\xc2\xa011, 2016, the Company reached an agreement with the owner of the Pinedale LGS whereby the owner agreed to withdraw its damages claims in exchange for the Company\xc2\x92s subsidiary assuming the Pinedale Operating Lease Agreement with no\ncost to cure.  All of the Company\xc2\x92s lease obligations are related to leases that are classified as\noperating leases.\xc2\xa0These leases contain certain provisions that could result in accelerated lease payments.\xc2\xa0The Company has considered the effect of these provisions on minimum lease payments in its lease classification analysis and has\ndetermined that the default provisions do not impact classification of any the Company\xc2\x92s operating leases. \nOffice space lease.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Company maintains office space in Colorado, Texas, Wyoming and Utah\nwith total remaining commitments for office leases of $6.6\xc2\xa0million at December\xc2\xa031, 2016. \n \xc2\xa0 73 \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n Item\xc2\xa07A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market\nRisk  Objectives and Strategy:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Company\xc2\x92s major market\nrisk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its natural gas and oil production. Realized pricing is currently driven primarily by the prevailing price for the Company\xc2\x92s Wyoming natural gas production. Historically, prices received for natural\ngas production have been volatile and unpredictable. Pricing volatility is expected to continue. As a result of its hedging activities, the Company may realize prices that are less than or greater than the spot prices that it would have received\notherwise.  The Company relies on various types of derivative instruments to manage its exposure to commodity\nprice risk and to provide a level of certainty in the Company\xc2\x92s forward cash flows supporting the Company\xc2\x92s capital investment program.  The Company\xc2\x92s hedging policy limits the amounts of resources hedged to not more than 50% of its forecast production without Board approval. \nFair Value of Commodity Derivatives:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0FASB ASC 815 requires that all derivatives be\nrecognized on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability and be measured at fair value. Changes in the derivative\xc2\x92s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. The Company does not\napply hedge accounting to any of its derivative instruments.  Derivative contracts that do not qualify for\nhedge accounting treatment are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at fair value on the balance sheet and the associated unrealized gains and losses are recorded as current expense or income in the income statement. Unrealized gains or\nlosses on commodity derivatives represent the non-cash change in the fair value of these derivative instruments and do not impact operating cash flows on the cash flow statement. \nCommodity Derivative Contracts:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At December\xc2\xa031, 2016, the Company had no open\ncommodity derivative contracts to manage price risk on a portion of its production.  The following table\nsummarizes the pre-tax realized and unrealized gains and losses the Company recognized related to its natural gas derivative instruments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended\nDecember\xc2\xa031, 2016, 2015 and 2014:  \xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nFor the Year Ended December\xc2\xa031,\n\xc2\xa0\n\n Commodity Derivatives (000\xc2\x92s):\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02016\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2015\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2014\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n Realized gain (loss) on commodity derivatives-natural gas(1)\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n$\n\xc2\x97\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n$\n146,801\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n$\n(48,170\n)\xc2\xa0\n\n Realized gain (loss) on commodity derivatives-crude oil(1)\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\x97\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\x97\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n506\n\xc2\xa0\n\n Unrealized gain (loss) on commodity derivatives(1)\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\x97\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n(104,190\n)\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n130,066\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n \xc2\xa0\n \xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n \xc2\xa0\n \xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n \xc2\xa0\n \xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\n Total gain (loss) on commodity derivatives\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n$\n\xc2\x97\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n$\n42,611\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n$\n82,402\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n \xc2\xa0\n \xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n \xc2\xa0\n \xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n \xc2\xa0\n \xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n \xc2\xa0\n\n\n(1)\n Included in gain (loss) on commodity derivatives in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n \xc2\xa0 74 \n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents', shape=(), dtype=string)
